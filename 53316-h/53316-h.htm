<h2>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>

<p>The following pages were prepared for the sole purpose
of forming an introduction to the foreign communications
contained in the Appendix to the Poor-Law
Report. Their separate publication was not
thought of until they had been nearly finished.
When it was first suggested to me, I felt it to be objectionable,
on account of their glaring imperfections,
if considered as forming an independent work, and
the impossibility of employing the little time which
can be withdrawn from a profession, in the vast task
of giving even an outline of the provision for the poor,
and the condition of the labouring classes, in the
whole of Europe and America. But the value and
extent of the information which, even in their present
incomplete state, they contain, and the importance
of rendering it more accessible than when
locked up in the folios of the Poor-Law Appendix,
have overcome my objections. The only addition
which I have been able to make is a translation of
the French documents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span></p>

<p>I cannot conclude without expressing my sense of
the zeal and intelligence with which the inquiry has
been prosecuted by his Majesty’s diplomatic Ministers
and Consuls, and of the active and candid assistance
which has been given by the foreign Governments.</p>

<h1>STATEMENT<br />
<span class="smaller">OF THE</span><br />
PROVISION FOR THE POOR,<br />
<span class="smaller">AND THE</span><br />
CONDITION OF THE LABOURING CLASSES,<br />
<span class="smaller">IN A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF</span><br />
AMERICA AND EUROPE.</h1>

<p>The Commissioners appointed by His Majesty to
make a diligent and full Inquiry into the practical
operation of the Laws for the relief of the Poor, were
restricted by the words of their Commission to England
and Wales. As it was obvious, however, that
much instruction might be derived from the experience
of other countries, the Commissioners were authorized
by Viscount Melbourne, then His Majesty’s
Principal Secretary of State for the Home Department,
to extend the investigation as far as might be
found productive of useful results. At first they endeavoured
to effect this object through their personal
friends, and in this manner obtained several valuable
communications. But as this source of information
was likely to be soon exhausted, they requested
Viscount Palmerston, then His Majesty’s Principal
Secretary of State for the Foreign Department, to
obtain the assistance of the Diplomatic Body.</p>

<p>In compliance with this application, Viscount
Palmerston, by a circular dated the 12th of August,
1833, requested each of His Majesty’s Foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Ministers to procure and transmit, with the least
possible delay, a full report of the legal provisions
existing in the country in which he was resident, for
the support and maintenance of the poor; of the
principles on which such provision was founded; of
the manner in which it was administered; of the
amount and mode of raising the funds devoted to
that purpose; and of the practical working and
effect of the actual system, upon the comfort, character,
and condition of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>The answers to these well-framed inquiries form a
considerable portion of the contents of the following
volume. They constitute, probably, the fullest collection
that has ever been made of laws for the relief
of the poor.</p>

<p>But as a subject of such extent would necessarily
be treated by different persons in different manners,
and various degrees of attention given to its separate
branches, the Commissioners thought it advisable
that a set of questions should also be circulated,
which, by directing the attention of each inquirer
and informant to uniform objects, would enable the
influence of different systems on the welfare of the
persons subjected to them to be compared.</p>

<p class="tbreak">For this purpose the following questions were
drawn up:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The following Questions apply to Customs and Institutions
whether general throughout the State, or peculiar to certain Districts,
and to Relief given:</p>

<ul>

<li>1st. By the Voluntary Payment of Individuals or Corporate
Bodies.</li>

<li>2nd. By Institutions specially endowed for that purpose.</li>

<li>3rd. By the Government, either general or local.</li>

<li>4th. By any one or more of these means combined.</li>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>And you are requested to state particularly the cases (if any)
in which the person relieved has a legal claim.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Extracts from the information on the Administration of the Poor Laws.</p>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>These questions, together with the volume to which
they refer, of Extracts of Information on the Administration
of the Poor Laws, were transmitted by
Viscount Palmerston to His Majesty’s Foreign Ministers
and Consuls on the 30th November, 1833.</p>

<p>The replies to them form the remaining contents
of the following pages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be perceived, therefore, that this volume
contains documents of three different kinds:</p>

<ul>

<li>1. Private Communications.</li>

<li>2. Diplomatic Answers to the general inquiries
suggested by Viscount Palmerston’s circular of the
12th of August, 1833.</li>

<li>3. Diplomatic Answers to the Questions framed
by the Commissioners, and contained in Viscount
Palmerston’s circular of the 30th November, 1833.</li>

</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, only a small portion of these documents
had arrived when the Commissioners made
their Report to His Majesty on the 20th February,
1834. The documents then received are contained
in the first 115 pages of this volume, and were printed
by order of the House of Commons, and delivered to
Members in May, 1834. Those subsequently received
were transmitted to the printers as soon as the
requisite translations of those portions which were
not written in English or French could be prepared.
If it had been practicable to defer printing any portion
until the whole was ready, they might have been
much more conveniently arranged. But to this
course there were two objections. First, the impossibility
of ascertaining from what places documents
would be received; and secondly, the difficulty of
either printing within a short period so large a
volume, containing so much tabular matter, or of
keeping the press standing for six or seven months.
The Parliamentary printers have a much larger stock
of type than any other establishment, but even their
resources did not enable them to keep unemployed
for months the type required for many hundred
closely-printed folio pages. The arrangement, therefore,
of the following papers is in a great measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
casual, depending much less on the nature of the
documents than on the times at which they were
received. The following short summary of their
contents, may, it is hoped, somewhat diminish this
inconvenience.</p>

<p>It is impossible, within the limits of a Preface, to
give more than a very brief outline of the large mass
of information contained in this volume, respecting
the provision made for the poor in America and in
the Continent of Europe.</p>

<hr />

<h2>AMERICA.</h2>

<p>It may be stated that, with respect to America, a
legal provision is made for paupers in every part of
the United States from which we have returns, excepting
Georgia and Louisiana; and that no such
provision exists in Brazil or in Hayti, or, as far as is
shown by these returns, in any of the countries
originally colonized by Spain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>The system in the United States was of course derived
from England, and modified in consequence,
not only of the local circumstances of the country,
but also of the prevalence of slavery in many of the
States, and of federal institutions which by recognising
to a certain extent each State as an independent
sovereignty, prevent the removal from one State of
paupers who are natives of another. Such paupers
are supported in some of the northern districts not
by local assessments, but out of the general income
of the State, under the name of state paupers.</p>

<p>The best mode of treating this description of paupers
is a matter now in discussion in the United
States.</p>

<p>The following passage in the report of the Commissioners
appointed to revise the civil code of Pennsylvania,
shows the inconveniences arising from the
absence of a national provision for them: (pp. 139,
143.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We may be permitted to suggest one alteration of the present
law, of considerable importance. In Massachusetts and New
York, and perhaps in some other States, paupers who have no
settlement in the State are relieved at the expense of the State.
In this commonwealth the burthen falls upon the particular
district in which the pauper may happen to be. This often occasions
considerable expense to certain counties or places from which
others are exempt. The construction of a bridge or canal, for
instance, will draw to a particular neighbourhood a large number
of labourers, many of whom may have no settlement in the
State. If disabled by sickness or accident, they must be relieved
by the township in which they became disabled, although their
labour was employed for the benefit of the State or county, as the
case may be, and not for the benefit of the township alone. If
provision were made for the payment of the expenses incurred by
the township in such case out of the county, or perhaps the State
treasury, we think that it would be more just, and that the unhappy
labourer would be more likely to obtain adequate relief,
than if left to the scanty resources of a single township. A case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
which is stated in the second volume of the Pennsylvania Reports
(<i>Overseers v. M’Coy</i>, p. 432), in which it appeared, that
a person employed as a labourer on the State Canal, and who
was severely wounded in the course of his employment, was
passed from one township to another, in consequence of the disinclination
to incur the expense of supporting him, until he died
of the injury received, shows in a strong light the inconvenience
and perils of the present system respecting casual paupers, and
may serve to excuse our calling the attention of the legislature
to the subject.</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, the Commissioners appointed
to revise the poor laws of Massachusetts, after stating
that the national provision in their State for the
unsettled poor has existed ever since the year 1675,
recommend its abolition, by arguments, a portion of
which we shall extract, as affording an instructive
picture of the worst forms of North American pauperism:
(pp. 59, 60, 61.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It will appear (say the Commissioners), that of the whole
number more or less assisted during the last year, that is, of
12,331 poor, 5927 were State’s poor, and 6063 were town’s
poor; making the excess of town’s over State’s poor to have
been only 497. The proportion which, it will be perceived, that
the State’s poor bear to the town’s poor, is itself a fact of startling
interest. We have not the means of ascertaining the actual
growth of this class of the poor. But if it may be estimated by
a comparison of the State’s allowance for them in 1792-3, the
amount of which, in round numbers, was $14,000, with the
amount of the allowance twenty-seven years afterwards, that is,
in 1820, when it was $72,000, it suggests matter for very serious
consideration. So sensitive, indeed, to the increasing weight of
the burthen had the legislature become even in 1798, when the
allowance was but $27,000 that “an Act” was passed, “specifying
the kind of evidence required to accompany accounts exhibited
for the support of the poor of the Commonwealth.” In
1821, with a view to still further relief from the evil, the law
limited its allowance to 90 cents a week for adults, and to 50
cents for children; and again, for the same end, it was enacted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
in 1823, that “no one over twelve, and under sixty years of age,
and in good health, should be considered a State pauper.” The
allowance is now reduced to 70 cents per week for adults, and
proportionally for children; and in the cases in which the poor
of this class have become an integral part of the population of
towns, and in which, from week to week, through protracted
sickness, or from any cause, they are for the year supported by
public bounty, the expense for them is sometimes greater than
this allowance. But this is comparatively a small proportion of
the State’s poor: far the largest part, as has been made to appear,
consists of those who are but occasionally assisted, and, in
some instances, of those of whom there seems to be good reason
to infer, from the expense accounts, that they make a return
in the product of their labour to those who have the charge of
them, which might well exonerate the Commonwealth from any
disbursements for their support. Even 70 cents a week, therefore,
or any definable allowance, we believe, has a direct tendency
to increase this class of the poor; for a charity will not generally
be very resolutely withheld, where it is known that, if dispensed,
it will soon be refunded. And we leave it to every one to judge
whether almsgiving, under the influence of this motive, and to
a single and defined class, has not a direct tendency at once to
the increase of its numbers, and to a proportionate earnestness
of importunity for it.</p>

<p>It is also not to be doubted, that a large proportion of this
excess of State’s poor, more or less assisted during the year,
consist of those who are called in the statements herewith presented,
“wandering or travelling poor.” The single fact of the
existence among us of this class of fellow-beings, especially considered
in connexion with the facts, that nearly all of them are
State’s poor, and that, to a great extent, they have been made
what they are by the State’s provision for them, brings the subject
before us in a bearing, in which we scarcely know whether
the call is loudest to the pity we should feel for them, or the self-reproach
with which we should recur to the measures we have
sanctioned, and which have alike enlarged their numbers and
their misery. Nor is it a matter of mere inference from our
tables, that the number is very large of these wandering poor.
To a considerable extent, and it is now regretted that it was not
to a greater extent, the inquiry was proposed to overseers of the
poor, “How many of the wandering, or travelling poor, annually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
pass under your notice?” And the answers, as will appear in
the statements, were from 10 to 50, and 100 to 200. Nor is
there a more abject class of our fellow-beings to be found in our
country than is this class of the poor. Almshouses, where they
are to be found, are their inns, at which they stop for refreshment.
Here they find rest, when too much worn with fatigue to
travel, and medical aid when they are sick. And, as they choose
not to labour, they leave these stopping places, when they have
regained strength to enable them to travel, and pass from town
to town, <i>demanding</i> their portion of the State’s allowance for
them as <i>their right</i>. And from place to place they receive a
portion of this allowance, as the easiest mode of getting rid of
them, and they talk of the allowance as their “rations;” and,
when lodged for a time, from the necessity of the case, with
town’s poor, it is their boast that they, by the State’s allowance
for them, support the town’s inmates of the house. These unhappy
fellow-beings often travel with females, sometimes, but not
always their wives; while yet, in the towns in which they take
up their temporary abode, they are almost always recognized and
treated as sustaining this relation. There are exceptions, but
they are few, of almshouses in which they are not permitted to
live together. In winter they seek the towns in which they hope
for the best accommodations and the best living, and where the
smallest return will be required for what they receive. It is
painful thus to speak of these human beings, lest, in bringing
their degradation distinctly before the mind, we should even for
a moment check the commiseration which is so strongly claimed
for them. We feel bound therefore to say, that bad as they are,
they are scarcely less sinned against in the treatment they receive,
than they commit sin in the lawlessness of their lives. Everywhere
viewed, and feeling themselves to be outcasts; possessed
of nothing, except the miserable clothing which barely covers
them; accustomed to beggary, and wholly dependent upon it;
with no local attachments, except those which grow out of the
facilities which in some places they may find for a more unrestrained
indulgence than in others; with no friendships, and
neither feeling nor awakening sympathy; is it surprising that
they are debased and shameless, alternately insolent and servile,
importunate for the means of subsistence and self-gratification,
and averse from every means but that of begging to obtain them?
The peculiar attraction of these unhappy fellow beings to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Commonwealth, and their preference for it over the States to the
south of us, we believe is to be found in the legal provision which
the State has made for them. Your Commissioners have indeed
but a small amount of direct evidence of this; but the testimony
of the chairman of the overseers in Egrement to this fact, derived
from personal knowledge, was most unequivocal, and no doubt
upon the subject existed in the minds of the overseers in many
other towns. But shall we therefore condemn, or even severely
blame, them? Considered and treated, in almost every place, as
interlopers, strollers, vagrants; as objects of suspicion and dread,
and, too often, scarcely as human beings; the cheapest methods
are adopted of sending them from town to town, and often with the
assurance given to them that <i>there</i>, and not <i>here</i>, are accommodations
for them, and that <i>there</i> they may enjoy the bounty which
the State has provided for them. Would such a state of things,
your Commissioners ask, have existed in our Commonwealth, if a
specific legal provision had not been made for this class of the
poor? Or, we do not hesitate to ask, if the Government had
never recognized such a class of the poor as that of State’s poor,&mdash;and,
above all, if compulsory charity, in any form, had never
been established by our laws, would there have been a twentieth
part of the wandering poor which now exists in it, or by any
means an equal proportion of poor of any kind with that which is
now dependent upon the taxes which are raised for them? Your
Commissioners think not.</p>

</div>

<p>Either an increase of the evils of pauperism, or a
clearer perception of them, has induced most of
the States during the last 10 years to make, both
in their laws for the relief of the poor and in the
administration of those laws, changes of great importance.
They consist principally in endeavouring
to avoid giving relief out of the workhouse, and in
making the workhouse an abode in which none but
the really destitute will continue. Compared with
our own, the system is, in general, rigid.</p>

<p>In the detailed account of the workhouses in
Massachusetts, (pages 68 to 93,) the separation of
the sexes appears to be the general rule wherever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
local circumstances do not interfere: a rule from
which exceptions are in some places made in favour
of married couples. And in the returns from many
of the towns it is stated that no relief is given out
of the house.</p>

<p>The following passages from the returns from
New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New York, are also
evidences of a general strictness of law and of administration.</p>

<p>By the laws of New Jersey,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The goods and chattels of any pauper applying for relief are to
be inventoried by the overseer before granting any relief, and
afterwards sold to reimburse the township, out of the proceeds, all
expenses they have been at; all sales of which by the pauper,
after he becomes chargeable, are void.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The same rule prevails in Pennsylvania. When
any person becomes chargeable, the overseers or
directors of the poor are required to sue for and
recover all his property, to be employed in defraying
the expense of his subsistence.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>By the laws of the same State,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>No person shall be entered on the poor-book of any district, or
receive relief from any overseers, before such person, or some one
in his behalf, shall have procured an order from two magistrates of
the county for the same; and in case any overseer shall enter in
the poor-book or relieve any such poor person without such order,
he shall forfeit a sum equal to the amount or value given, unless
such entry or relief shall be approved of by two magistrates as
aforesaid. (p. 142.)</p>

</div>

<p>Nor is the relief always given gratuitously, or
the pauper always at liberty to accept and give it
up as he may think fit; for by a recent enactment<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
the guardians are authorized&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>To open an account with the pauper, and to charge him for his
maintenance, and credit him the value of his services; and all
idle persons who may be sent to the almshouse by any of the said
guardians, may be detained in the said house by the board of
guardians, and compelled to perform such work and services as the
said board may order and direct, until they have compensated by
their labour for the expenses incurred on their account, unless
discharged by special permission of the board of guardians; and
it shall be the duty of the said board of guardians to furnish such
person or persons as aforesaid with sufficient work and employment,
according to their physical abilities, so that the opportunity
of reimbursement may be fully afforded: and for the more complete
carrying into effect the provisions of this law, the said board
of guardians are hereby authorized and empowered to exercise
such authority as may be necessary to compel all persons within the
said almshouse and house of employment to do and perform all
such work, labour, and services as may be assigned to them by the
said board of guardians, provided the same be not inconsistent
with the condition or ability of such person.</p>

<p>And whereas it frequently happens that children who have been
receiving public support for indefinite periods are claimed by their
parents when they arrive at a proper age for being bound out, the
guardians are authorized to bind out all children that have or may
receive public support, either in the almshouse or children’s
asylum, although their parents may demand their discharge from
the said institutions, unless the expenses incurred in their support
be refunded.</p>

</div>

<p>In New York the administration of the law is
even more severe than this enactment:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>With respect to poor children, (says Mr. Buchanan,) a system
prevails in New York, which, though seemingly harsh and unfeeling,
has a very powerful influence to deter families from resorting
to the commissioners of the poor for support, or an
asylum in the establishment for the poor; namely, that the commissioners
or overseers apprentice out the children, and disperse
them to distant parts of the State; and on no account will inform
the parents where they place their children. (p. 110.)</p>

<h2>EUROPE.</h2>

<p>It appears from the returns that a legal claim to
relief exists in Norway, Sweden, Russia, Denmark,
Mecklenburg, Prussia, Wurtemberg, Bavaria, and
the Canton de Berne; but does not exist in the
Hanseatic Towns, Holland, Belgium, France, Portugal,
the Sardinian States, Frankfort, Venice,
Greece, or Turkey. The return from Saxony does
not afford data from which the existence or non-existence
of such a claim can be inferred.</p>

<p>The great peculiarity of the system in the North
of Europe is the custom of affording relief by quartering
the paupers on the landholders in the country
and on householders in the towns.</p>

<hr />

<h3>NORWAY.</h3>

<p>Consuls Greig and Mygind, the authors of the
return from Norway, state, that the&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Impotent through age, cripples, and others who cannot subsist
themselves, are, in the country districts, billeted or quartered on
such of the inhabitants (house and landholders in the parish) as
have the means of providing for them. By them they are furnished
with clothing and food, and they are in return expected to
perform such light services as they can. In the distribution,
respect is had to the extent or value of the different farms, and
to the number of the indigent, which varies greatly in different
parishes. In some they have so few poor that only one pauper
falls to the lot of five or six farms, who then take him in rotation;
whilst in other parishes they have a pauper quartered on
every farm or estate all the year round, and on the larger ones
several. (p. 696.)</p>

</div>

<p>It is to be regretted that the information respecting
the existing poor laws of Norway is not more full
and precise. The return contains two projects of
law, or in other words, bills, for the relief of the poor
in the country and in towns, drawn up in 1832, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
obedience to a government commission issued in
1829; and also the arguments of the commissioners
in their support; but it does not state how far
these projects have been adopted.</p>

<p>In treating of the modes of relief, the bill for the
country states that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Section 26. The main principle to be observed everywhere in
affording relief is to maintain “lœgd,” or the outquartering of
the paupers, wherever it has existed or can be introduced, taking
care to avoid the separation of families. The regulation of
“lœgd,” where it has been once established among the farms,
should be as durable and as little liable to alteration as possible;
so that a fresh arrangement should be made only in instances
where there exists a considerable decrease or increase in the
number of the paupers quartered out, or a marked alteration in
the condition of the occupiers upon whom they are so quartered.
In the event of a fresh arrangement, it is desirable that the existing
paupers hitherto provided for should, in as far as may be
consistent with justice towards the parties to whom they are
quartered, continue to have “lœgd” upon the same farm or
farms where they have hitherto been relieved. Families not belonging
to the class of peasants are bound to have paupers quartered
upon them in “lœgd” in case they cultivate land; however,
the overseer of the district is competent to grant permission to
them as well as to other “lœgds-ydere,” to let out the “lœgd”
when he finds that they individually are unable to provide for the
pauper on their own lands, and the letting out can be effected
without any considerable inconvenience to the latter. (p. 704.)</p>

<p>27. When a new regulation of “lœgd” takes place, or new
“lœgd” is established, a statement in writing of the “lœgd,” or
outquartering intended, is to be issued by the commission, or by
the overseer on its behalf, containing the name of the pauper to
be outquartered, and the farm or farms on which he shall receive
“lœgd,” and in case it is on several, the rotation, and for what
period, on each. In case the “lœgd” is only to be during the
winter, or during a certain part of the year, this likewise is to be
stated. In like manner the houseless and others, who are provided
with relief in kind from particular farms, are to be furnished
with a note setting forth the quantity the individual has to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
demand of each farm, and the time at which he is entitled to demand
the same. In default of the furnishing of these contributions
in proper time, they are to be enforced by execution,
through the lensmand. (p. 705.)</p>

<p>5. In case the house poor, and other poor who are not quartered
out, conduct themselves improperly, are guilty of idleness,
drunkenness, incivility, obstinacy or quarrelsomeness, the overseer
is entitled to give them a serious reprimand; and in case
this is unattended with any effect, to propose in the poor commission
the reduction of the allowance granted to the offender, to
the lowest scale possible. Should this prove equally devoid of
effect, or the allowance not bear any reduction, he may, in conjunction
with the president of the commission, report the case, at
the same time stating the names of the witnesses, to the sorenskriver<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>,
who on the next general or monthly sitting of the court,
after a brief inquiry, by an unappealable sentence shall punish the
guilty with imprisonment not exceeding 20 days, upon bread and
water.</p>

<p>In case of a like report from the superintendent of the “lœgd,”
of improper conduct on the part of the pauper quartered out, the
overseer shall give the said offending pauper a severe reprimand;
and in case this likewise proves devoid of effect, the mode of proceeding
to be the same as has been stated already in reference to
the house poor.</p>

<p>36. In case the person with whom a pauper has been quartered
out do not supply adequate relief, or ill use the pauper so quartered
upon him, and is regardless of the admonitions of the overseer,
an appeal to the sorenskriver is to take place, and in other
respects the mode of proceeding is to be the same as is enacted in
s. 35: when all the conduct complained of can be proved, for
which purpose, in default of other witnesses, the combined evidence
of the superintendent of the “lœgd,” and of the overseer,
is to be deemed sufficient, the offending party to be fined, according
to his circumstances and the nature of the case, from 2 to 20
specie dollars, and in case of ill-usage, to be imprisoned on bread
and water for from 5 to 10 days; and in the event of a repetition
of the offence, for from 10 to 20 days.</p>

<p>39. None may beg, but every person who is in such want that
he cannot provide for himself and those belonging to him, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
apply for aid to the competent poor commission, or to the overseer.
In case any one is guilty of begging, for the first offence
he is to be seriously admonished by the overseer of the district in
which he has begged, who is likewise to point out to him what
consequences will follow a repetition of the offence. In case he
offends afterwards, he is to be punished according to the enactments
set forth in s. 35; and afterwards, in case of a repetition
of the offence, with from two months’ to a year’s confinement in
the house of correction.</p>

<p>A person is not to be accounted a beggar who asks only for
food, when it appears that his want of sustenance is so great that
unless he tried to procure immediate relief he would be exposed to
perish of hunger, provided he immediately afterwards applies to
the overseer of the district for relief; or in case the poor administration
is unable to relieve all the poor in years of scarcity,
save in a very scanty manner, and the hungry mendicant then
confines himself to the soliciting of food. (p. 706.)</p>

</div>

<p>The bill directs that the poor-fund shall consist,
in the country,</p>

<p>1. Of the interest of legacies, and other property
belonging to it.</p>

<p>2. An annual tax of 12 skillings (equal according
to Dr. Kelly, Univ. Cambist, vol. 1, p. 32, to
2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> sterling,) on each hunsmand or cottager, and
on each man servant, and six skillings on each
woman servant.</p>

<p>3. A duty on stills equal to half the duty paid to
the State.</p>

<p>4. Penalties directed by the existing laws to be
paid over to that fund.</p>

<p>5. The property left by paupers, if they leave no
wife or children unprovided for.</p>

<p>6. An annual assessment on the occupiers of
land, and on all others capable of contributing,
such as men servants, clerks, tutors, and pilots.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>In towns,</p>

<p>Of all the above-mentioned funds, except No. 2,
and of a tax of one skilling (2½<i>d.</i> sterling) per pot
on all imported fermented liquors.</p>

<p>We have already remarked that the report does
not state how far this bill has passed into a law, or
how its enactments differ from the existing law:
they appear likely, unless counteracted by opposing
causes, to lead to considerable evils. The relief
by way of lœgd resembles in some respects our
roundsman system. It is, however, less liable to
abuse in one respect, because the lœgd, being
wholly supported by the lœgd-yder, must be felt
as an incumbrance by the farmer, instead of a
source of profit. On the other hand, the situation
of the country pauper cannot be much worse than
that of the independent labourer; and in towns,
though this temptation to idleness and improvidence
may be avoided by giving relief in the workhouse,
the temptation to give out-door and profuse
relief must be considerable, since a large portion
of the poor-fund is derived from general sources,
and only a small part from assessment to which the
distributors of relief are themselves exposed. It is
probable that the excellent habits of the population,
and the great proportion of landowners, may
enable the Norwegians to support a system of relief
which in this country would soon become intolerable.</p>

<h3>SWEDEN.</h3>

<p>The fullest statement of the pauperism of Sweden
is to be found in a paper by M. de Hartsmansdorff,
the Secretary of State for Ecclesiastical Affairs,
(p. 368); an extract from Colonel Forsell’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Swedish Statistics, published in 1833, (p. 375);
and Replies to the Commissioners’ Queries from
Stockholm, (p. 372), and from Gottenburgh, (p.
384.)</p>

<p>M. de Hartsmansdorff states that every parish is
bound to support its own poor, and that the fund
for that purpose arises from voluntary contribution,
(of which legacies and endowments appear to form
a large portion,) the produce of certain fines and
penalties, and rates levied in the country in proportion
to the value of estates, and in towns on the
property or income of the inhabitants. Settlement
depends on residence, and on that ground the inhabitants
of a parish may prevent a stranger from
residing among them. A similar provision is considered
in the Norwegian report, and rejected,
(p. 718,) but exists in almost every country adopting
the principle of parochial relief, and allowing a
settlement by residence. An appeal is given, both
to the pauper and to the parishioners, to the governor
of the province, and ultimately to the King.</p>

<p>M. de Hartsmansdorff’s paper is accompanied by
a table, containing the statement of the persons relieved
in 1829, which states them to have amounted
to 63,348 out of a population of 2,780,132, or
about one in forty-two. This differs from Colonel
Forsell’s statement, (p. 376,) that in 1825 they
amounted to 544,064, or about one in five. It is
probable that Colonel Forsell includes all those
who received assistance from voluntary contributions.
“In Stockholm,” he adds, “there are 83
different boards for affording relief to the poor, independent
one of the other, so that it happens
often that a beggar receives alms at three, four, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
five different places.” There is also much discrepancy
as to the nature and extent of the relief
afforded to the destitute able-bodied. We are told
in the Stockholm return, (p. 372,) that no legal
provision is made for them; but by the Gottenburgh
return, (pp. 384 and 386,) it appears that they are
relieved by being billeted on householders, or by
money.</p>

<p>The following severe provisions of the law of
the 19th June, 1833, seem directed against them.
By that law any person who is without property
and cannot obtain employment, or neglects to provide
himself with any, and cannot obtain sureties
for the payment of his taxes, rates, and penalties,
is denominated unprotected (förswarlös). An unprotected
person is placed almost at the disposal
of the police, who are to allow him a fixed period
to obtain employment, and to require him to proceed
in search of it to such places as they think fit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Should any person, (the law goes on to say,) who has led an
irreproachable life, and has become unprotected, not through an
unsteady or reprehensible conduct, but from causes which
cannot be reasonably laid to his charge, and who has obtained
an extension of time for procuring protection, still remains
without yearly employment or other lawful means of support,
and not be willing to try in other places to gain the means of
support, or shall have transgressed the orders that may have been
given him, and (being a male person) should not prefer to enlist
in any regiment, or in the royal navy, or should not possess the
requisite qualifications for that purpose, the person shall be sent
to be employed on such public works as may be going on in the
neighbourhood, or to a work institution within the county, until
such time as another opportunity may offer for his maintenance;
he shall however be at liberty, when the usual notice-day arrives,
and until next moving-time, to try to obtain legal protection with
any person within the county who may require his services, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the obligation to return to the public work institution in the event
of his not succeeding. Should there be no public work to be had
in the neighbourhood, or the person cannot, for want of necessary
room, be admitted, he shall be sent to a public house of correction,
and remain there, without however being mixed with evil-disposed
persons or such as may have been punished for crimes,
until some means may be found for him or her to obtain a lawful
maintenance.&mdash;(p. 362.)</p>

<p>Servants or other unprotected persons who have of their own
accord relinquished their service or constant employ, and by
means of such or other reprehensible conduct have been legally
turned out of their employ, or who do not perform service with
the master or mistress who has allowed such person to be rated
and registered with them, or who, in consequence of circumstances
which ought to be ascribed to the unprotected person himself,
shall become deprived of their lawful means of support, but
who may not be considered as evil-disposed persons, shall be
bound to provide themselves with lawful occupations within 14
days, if it be in a town, and within double that number of days if
it be in the country. Should the unprotected person not be able
to accomplish this, it shall depend on Our lord-lieutenant how
far he may deem it expedient to grant a further extended time,
for a limited period, to a person thus circumstanced, in order to
procure himself means for his subsistence.&mdash;(p. 363).</p>

<p>Such persons as may either not have been considered to be
entitled to an extension of time for procuring lawful maintenance,
or who, notwithstanding such permission, have not been able to
provide themselves with the same, shall be liable to do work, if a
man, at any of the corps of pioneers in the kingdom, and if a
woman, at a public house of correction. If the man is unfit for
a pioneer, he shall in lieu thereof be sent to a public house of
correction.&mdash;(p. 363.)</p>

</div>

<p>It appears that pauperism has increased under
the existing system. Mr. Bloomfield states that
since its institution the number of poor has increased
in proportion to the population (p. 368).
The Stockholm return states that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The main defect of the charitable institutions consists in a
very imperfect control over the application of their funds, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
parish not being accountable for their distribution to any superior
authority. This is so much felt, that new regulations are contemplated
for bringing parish affairs more under the inspection of
a central board. Another great evil is, that each parish manages
its affairs quite independently of any other, and frequently in a
totally different manner; and there is no mutual inspection
among the parishes, which, it is supposed, would check abuses.
Again, parishes are not consistent in affording relief; they
often receive and treat an able-bodied impostor (who legally has
no claim on the parish) as an impotent or sick person, whilst
many of the latter description remain unaided.</p>

<p>The Swedish artizan is neither so industrious nor so frugal as
formerly; he has heard that the destitute able-bodied are in
England supported by the parish; he claims similar relief, and
alleges his expectation of it as an excuse for prodigality or indifference
to saving.&mdash;(p. 375.)</p>

<p>That the number of poor (says Colonel Forsell) has lately increased
in a far greater progression than before, is indeed a
deplorable truth. At Stockholm, in the year 1737, the number
of poor was 930; in 1825 there were reckoned 15,000 indigent
persons. Their support, in 1731, cost 9000 dollars (dallar). In
1825, nearly 500,000 rix dollars banco were employed in alms, donations,
and pensions. Perhaps these facts explain why, in Stockholm,
every year about 1500 individuals more die than are born,
although the climate and situation of this capital is by no means
insalubrious; for the same may be said of almshouses as is said
of foundling hospitals and similar charitable establishments, that
the more their number is increased, the more they are applied to.</p>

<p>In the little and carefully governed town of Orebro, the number
of poor during the year 1780 was no more than 70 or 80 individuals,
and in the year 1832 it was 400! In the parish of
Nora, in the province of Nerike, the alms given in the year 1814
were 170 rix-dollars 4 sk.; and in 1832, 2138 rix-dollars 27 sk.;
and so on at many other places in the kingdom. That the case
was otherwise in Sweden formerly, is proved by history. Botin
says that a laborious life, abhorrence of idleness and fear of
poverty, was the cause why indigent and destitute persons could
be found, but no beggars. Each family sustained its destitute
and impotent, and would have deemed it a shame to receive support
from others.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><div class="sidenote">The price of
8 kappar =
1½ doll., or
2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i></div>

<p>When the accounts required from the secretary of state for
ecclesiastical affairs, regarding the number of and institutions for
the poor, shall be reduced to order, and issue from the press, they
must impart most important information. By the interesting
report on this subject by the Bishop of Wexio, we learn, that the
proportion of the poor to the population is as 1 to 73 in the
government of Wexio, and as 1 to 54 in that of Jönköping.
The assessed poor-taxes are, on an average, for every farm
(hemman,) eight kappar corn in the former government, and 12½
in the latter. With regard to the institutions for the poor, it is
said, the more we give the more is demanded, and instead of the
poor-rates being regulated by the want, the want is regulated
by the profusion of charities and poor-taxes.</p>

<p>In the bishopric of Wisby (Island of Gottland), the proportion
between the poor and those who can maintain themselves, is far
more favourable than in that of Wexio; for in the former only 1 in
104 inhabitants is indigent, and in 22 parishes there is no common
almshouse at all. Among 40,000 individuals, no more than 17
were unable to read.&mdash;(p. 377.)</p>

<h3>RUSSIA.</h3>

<p>A general outline of the provision for the poor in
Russia, is contained in the following extracts from
Mr. Bligh’s report, (pp. 328, 329, 330).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>As far as regards those parts of the empire which may most
properly be called Russia, it will not be necessary for me to
detain your Lordship long, since in them (where in fact by far
the greatest portion of the population is to be found), the
peasantry, being in a state of slavery, the lords of the soil are
induced more by their own interest, than compelled by law, to
take care that its cultivators, upon whom their means of deriving
advantage from their estates depend, are not entirely without the
means of subsistence.</p>

<p>Consequently, in cases of scarcity, the landed proprietors frequently
feel themselves under the necessity (in order to prevent
their estates from being depopulated) of expending large sums,
for the purpose of supplying their serfs with provisions from more
favoured districts. There is no doubt, however, (of which they
must be well aware) that in case of their forgetting so far the dictates
of humanity and of self-interest, as to refuse this assistance to
the suffering peasantry, the strong hand of a despotic government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
would compel them to afford it.</p>

<p>The only cases, therefore, of real misery, which are likely to
arise, are, when soldiers, who having outlived their 25 years’
service, and all the hardships of a Russian military life, fail in
getting employment from the government as watchmen in the
towns, or in other subordinate situations, and returning to their
villages, find themselves unsuited by long disuse to agricultural
pursuits, disowned by the landed proprietors, from whom their
military service has emancipated them, and by their relations and
former acquaintances, who have forgotten them.</p>

<p>I am led to understand, that in all well-regulated properties, in
order to provide for the contingencies of bad seasons, the peasants
are obliged to bring, to a magazine established by the proprietor,
a certain portion of their crops, to which they may have recourse
in case of need.</p>

<p>In the estates belonging to the government, which are already
enormous, and which are every day increasing, in consequence
of the constant foreclosing of the mortgages by which so many
of the nobility held their estates under the crown, more special
enactments are in vigour; inasmuch as in them, all serfs incapable
of work are supported by their relations, and those whose
relations are too poor to afford them assistance, are taken into
what may be termed poor-houses, which are huts, one for males,
the other for females, built in the neighbourhood of the church,
at the expense of the section or parish, which is also bound to
furnish the inmates with fuel, food, and clothing.</p>

<p>The parish must, moreover, establish hospitals for the sick, for
the support of which, besides boxes for receiving alms, at the
church and in the hospitals themselves, all fines levied in the
parish are to be applied.</p>

<p>The clergy are compelled to provide for the poor of their class,
according to an ordonnance, regulating the revenues set apart
for this object, and enacting rules for the distribution of private
bequests and charities.</p>

<p>In <i>Courland</i>, <i>Esthonia</i>, and <i>Livonia</i>, the parish (or community)
are bound to provide for the destitute to the utmost of
their means, which means are to be derived from the common
funds; from bequests, or from any charitable or poor fund which
may exist; and in Esthonia, from the reserve magazines of corn,
which, more regularly than in Russia, are kept full by contributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from every peasant.</p>

<p>When those are inadequate, a levy is made on the community,
which is fixed by the elders and confirmed by the district authorities;
and when this rate is levied, the landowners or farmers
contribute in proportion to the cultivation and works they carry
on, or to the amount of rent they pay; and the labourers according
to the wages they receive.</p>

<p>The overseers consist of the elder of the village, (who is
annually elected by the peasantry) and two assistants, one of
whom is chosen from the class of landholders or farmers, and the
other from the labourers, and who are confirmed by the district
police. One of these assistants has to give quarterly detailed
accounts to the district authorities, and the elder, on quitting
office, renders a full account to the community.</p>

<p>Those who will not work voluntarily may be delivered over to
any individual, and compelled to work for their own support, at
the discretion of the elder and his assistants.</p>

<p>Those poor who are found absent from home, are placed in the
hands of the police, and transferred to their own parishes.</p>

<p>All public begging is forbid by very strict regulations.</p>

<p>In the external districts of the <i>Siberian Kirghese</i>, which are
for the most part peopled by wandering tribes, the authorities are
bound to prevent, by every means in their power, any individual
of the people committed to their charge from suffering want, or
remaining without superintendence or assistance, in case of their
being in distress.</p>

<p>All the charitable offerings of the Kirghese are received by the
district authorities, and as they consist for the most part of cattle,
they are employed, as far as necessary, for the service of the
charitable institutions; the surplus is sold, and the proceeds,
together with any donations in money, go towards the support of
those establishments; when voluntary contributions are not sufficient
for that purpose, the district authorities give in an estimate
of the quantity of cattle of all sorts required to make up the deficiency,
and according to their estimate, when confirmed by the
general government, the number of cattle required in each place
is sent from the general annual levy made for the service of the
government.</p>

<p>In the <i>Polish Provinces</i> incorporated with the empire, as the
state of the population is similar to that of Russia Proper, the
proprietors in like manner, in cases of need, supply their peasantry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with the means of existence; under ordinary circumstances,
however, the portions of land allotted to them for cultivation,
which afford them not only subsistence, but the means of paying
a fixed annual sum to their lords, and the permission which is
granted to them of cutting wood in the forests for building and
fuel, obviate the necessity of their receiving this aid.</p>

<p>The same system existed in the <i>Duchy of Warsaw</i> prior to
1806, and every beggar and vagabond was then sent to the place
of his birth, where, as there was not a sufficiency of hands for
the cultivation of the soil, he was sure to find employment, or to be
taken care of by his master, whilst there were enough public establishments
for charity to support the poor in the towns belonging
to the government, and those, who by age, sickness, or natural
deformities, were unable to work.</p>

<p>But when the establishment of a regular code proclaimed all
the inhabitants of that part of <i>Poland</i> equal in the eye of the
law, the relations of the proprietor and the peasant were entirely
changed; and the former having no power of detaining the latter
upon his lands, except for debt legally recognised, was no longer
obliged to support them.</p>

<p>So great and sudden a change in the social state of the
country soon caused great embarrassment to the government,
who being apprehensive of again altering a system which involved
the interests of the landed proprietors, the only influential
class in the country, for a long time eluded the consideration of the
question, by augmenting the charitable institutions; but at length
the progressive expense of this system compelled the Minister of
Finance to refuse all further aid to uphold it, and by an arbitrary
enactment, recourse was had to the former plan of passing
the poor to the places of their birth. As this arrangement is only
considered as provisional, and as the population has not hitherto
more than sufficed for the purpose of agriculture, and the manufactories
which were established prior to the late insurrection, it
has not been much complained of, though the necessity for some
more precise and positive regulations respecting the poor is
generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>In <i>Finland</i>, there are no laws in force for the support of the indigent,
nor any charitable establishments, except in some of the
towns. In the country districts it is expected that reserve magazines
of corn should be kept in every parish, but I cannot ascertain
that the adoption of this precautionary measure is imperative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
upon the landed proprietors and peasantry.</p>

</div>

<p>On comparing, however, Mr. Bligh’s statement
as to the law in Courland with that made by
M. Kienitz His Majesty’s Consul, it does not seem
that the provision afforded by law is often enforced,
excepting as to the support of infirmaries. It
appears from his report that the government provides
expeditiously for vagrants by enrolling them
as soldiers or setting them on the public works;
and that the proportion of the population to the
means of subsistence is so small, and the demand
for labour so great, that scarcely any other able-bodied
paupers are to be found.</p>

<hr />

<h3>DENMARK.</h3>

<p>The information respecting Denmark is more
complete and derived from more sources than any
other return contained in this volume.</p>

<p>The Danish poor law is recent. It appears
(p. 278) to have originated in 1798, and to have
assumed its present form in 1803. The following
statement of its principal provisions is principally
extracted from Mr. Macgregor’s report (pp. 280,
283, 284-7, 288, 273-285, 289, 290).</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<div class="sidenote">Poor districts.</div>

<p>Each <i>market town</i>, or kiöbstœd, (of which there are 65 in
Denmark,) constitutes a separate poor district, in which are also
included those inhabitants of the adjacent country who belong to
the parish of that town. In the <i>country</i>, each parish forms a
poor district.</p>

<p>The poor laws are administered in the <i>market towns</i> by a
board of commissioners, consisting of the curate, of one of the
magistrates (if any), of the provost (byefoged) in his quality of
policemaster, and of two or more of the most respectable inhabitants
of the place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>In the <i>country</i> this is done in each district by a similar board,
of which the curate, the policemaster, besides one of the principal
landholders, and three to four respectable inhabitants, are members,
which latter are nominated for a term of three years.</p>

<p>All persons are to be considered as destitute and entitled to
relief, who are unable, with their own labour, to earn the means
of subsistence, and thus, without the help of others, would be
deprived of the absolute necessaries of life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Classification
of
paupers.</div>

<p>The poor to whom parochial relief may be awarded, are
divided into three classes. To the <i>first class</i> belong the aged
and the sick, and all those who from bodily or mental infirmity
are wholly or partially debarred from earning the means of subsistence.
In the <i>second class</i> are included orphans, foundlings,
and deserted children, as well as those, the health, resources, or
morals of whose parents are of a description which would render
it improper to confide the education of children to their care.
The <i>third class</i> comprises families or single persons, who from
constitutional weakness, a numerous offspring, the approach of
old age or similar causes, are unable to earn a sufficiency for the
support of themselves or children.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief to
first class.</div>

<p>Paupers of the first class who are destitute of other support, are
to be supplied by the proper parish officers:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) With food (or in market towns where the necessary establishments
for that purpose are wanting, with money in lieu
thereof); to which, in the agricultural districts, the inhabitants
have to contribute, according to the orders issued by the commissioners,
either in bread, flour, pease, groats, malt, bacon,
butter or cheese, or in corn, or in money, or by rations, or in
any other manner, which, from local circumstances, may be
deemed most expedient:</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) With the necessary articles of clothing:</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) With lodging and fuel, either by placing them in establishments
belonging to the parish, or in private dwellings:</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) With medical attendance, either at their own dwellings, or
in places owned or rented by the parish.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To second.</div>

<p>The children belonging to the second class are to be placed
with a private family, to be there brought up and educated at the
expense of the parish, until they can be apprenticed or provided
for in any other manner.</p>

<p>The commissioners are carefully to watch over the treatment
and education of the children by their foster-parents, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
such of them as have been put out to service are properly brought
up and instructed until they are confirmed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">To third.</div>

<p>The paupers of the third class are to be so relieved that they
may not want the absolute necessaries of life; but avoiding mendicity
on the one hand, they must at the same time be compelled
to work to the best of their abilities for their maintenance. To
render the relief of paupers of this description more effectual, care
must be taken that, if possible, work be procured for them at the
usual rate of wages; and where the amount does not prove sufficient
for their support they may be otherwise assisted, but in
general not with money, but with articles of food and clothing,
to be supplied them at the expense of the parish.</p>

<p>In cases where families are left houseless, the commissioners are
authorized to procure them a habitation, by becoming security
for the rent; and where such habitation is not to be obtained for
them, they may be quartered upon the householders in rotation,
until a dwelling can be found in some other place.</p>

<p>Should the rent not be paid by the parties when due, such persons
must be considered as paupers, and be removed to that district
where they may be found to have a settlement. The house-rent
thus disbursed must in this case be looked upon as temporary
relief, and be borne by the parish that advanced it. Where
parish-officers refuse to obey these injunctions, they may be compelled
by a fine, to be levied daily until they comply.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liabilities
of pauper.</div>

<p>The Danish law has established the principle, that every individual
receiving relief of any kind under the poor-laws, is bound,
either with his property or his labour, to refund the amount so
disbursed for him, or any part thereof; and authority has therefore
been given to the poor-law commissioners, “to require all
those whom it may concern, to work to the best of their ability,
until all they owe has been paid off.”</p>

<p>On relief being awarded to a pauper, the commissioners of
the district have forthwith to take an inventory of, and to appraise,
his effects, which are only to be delivered over to him for his use,
after having been marked with the stamp of the board.</p>

<p>Any person receiving goods or effects so marked, either by way
of purchase or in pledge, shall be liable to the restitution of the
property, to the payment of its value, and besides to a fine.</p>

<p>The same right is retained by the parish upon the pauper, if he
should happen to acquire property at a later period, as well as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
extends to his effects at his demise, though he should not have
received relief at the time of his death.</p>

<p>An ordinance of the 13th of August, 1814, expressly enacts,
that wherever a person absolutely refuses either to refund or to
pay by instalments the debt he has so contracted with the parish,
he shall be forced to pay it off by working for the benefit of the
same, and not be allowed to leave the parish; but that if he do so
notwithstanding, he is to be punished by imprisonment in the
house of correction. The commissioners are further authorized
to stipulate the amount such individual is to pay off per week, in
proportion to his capability to work, to the actual rate of wages
and other concurring circumstances, and that where such person
either refuses to work, or is idle or negligent during the working
hours, he is to be imprisoned on bread and water until he reform
his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Begging.</div>

<p>The poor having thus been provided for, begging is prohibited,
and declared to be liable to punishment.</p>

<p>In adjudging punishment for begging, it is to be taken into
consideration whether the mendicant was in need of support or
not. In the first case he shall, the first time, be imprisoned fourteen
days; the second time, four weeks; and the third time, work
for a year in the house of correction. For every time the offence
is committed, the punishment to be doubled. But if the mendicant
is able to work, and thus not entitled to support from the
parish, he shall, the first time, be imprisoned four weeks; the
second time, eight weeks; and the third time, work for two years
in the house of correction, which last punishment is to be doubled
for every time the offence is committed. When the term of
punishment is expired, the beggar is to be sent to his home under
inspection, and his travelling expenses by land in every parish
through which he passes to be paid by the poor-chest of the
bailiwick in which the parish lies; but his conveyance by water
to be paid by the parish bound to receive him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Duty of the
poor to seek
service.</div>

<p>In the market-towns, all persons belonging to the working
classes are obliged to enter into fixed service, unless they have
some ostensible means of subsistence, which must be proved to
the satisfaction of the magistrates, if required.</p>

<p>In the agricultural districts, every person belonging to the class
of peasants, who is not a proprietor or occupier of land, a tacksman
(<i>boelsmand</i>), or cottager (<i>huusmand</i>), or subsists upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
some trade or profession, is to seek fixed service, unless he be
married and permanently employed as a day-labourer.</p>

<p>Where a single person of either sex belonging to the labouring
class is not able to obtain a place, he (or she) shall within two
months before the regular term when regular servants are changed
(Skiftetid) apply to the parish-beadle, who, on the Sunday following
at church-meeting, is publicly to offer the services of his
client, and inquire amongst the community if any person is in
want of a servant, and will receive him (or her) as such. Should
the said person not get a place within a fortnight, a similar inquiry
is to be made in the neighbouring parish.</p>

<p><i>All those that have not followed the line of conduct pointed
out in the preceding regulation, and are without steady employment,
shall be considered as vagrants, and punished accordingly.</i></p>

<p>It is also provided, that where parents, without sufficient reason,
keep more grown up children at home than they absolutely require
for their service, it shall be considered indicative, either of their
being in comparatively good circumstances, or that their income
has been improved by the additional labour of their children, and
their poor and school-rates are to be raised in proportion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mode of
raising
fund.</div>

<p>It is not only made obligatory upon the house and landowners
to contribute to the parochial fund, but also upon servants and
labouring mechanics; in short, upon all persons, without distinction
of religion, who are not on the parish themselves, and whose
circumstances are such that they can afford to pay the contribution
in proportion to their incomes, without thereby depriving themselves
of the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>The only exception are the military, and persons receiving pay
from the military fund, who are only liable to contribute in so far
as they have private means.</p>

<p>The receipts of the parochial fund are derived from various
sources, which may be classed under the following heads, viz.&mdash;</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Parochial
fund.</div>

<p>1ᵒ. An annual contribution in money, either voluntary or levied
upon the inhabitants, according to the assessment of the board of
commissioners in each parish, and in proportion to the amount
annually required for the relief of the poor.</p>

<p>This contribution is recovered in four quarterly instalments,
each of which is payable in advance. The commissioners have
to transmit a list of those persons that are in arrears to the bailiff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
of the division, who may levy the amount by distress.</p>

<p>2ᵒ. A contribution assessed upon the produce of the ground-tax
in the townships.</p>

<p>3ᵒ. One-quarter per cent. of the proceeds of goods and effects
sold by public auction in the townships.</p>

<p>4ᵒ. Fines and penalties adjudged to the parochial fund by the
courts of justice, and the commissioners of arbitration in the
townships.</p>

<p>5ᵒ. Produce of collections in churches and hospitals on certain
occasions; of the sale of the effects of paupers deceased; of the
sale of stray cattle having no owner; voluntary donations on the
purchase or sale of houses and lands; contingencies.</p>

<p>6ᵒ. Interest on capital, and rent of lands or houses bequeathed
to, or otherwise acquired by, the poor administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Bailiwick
fund.</div>

<p>The receipts of the separate poor fund of the bailiwick consist
chiefly,&mdash;1ᵒ. In a proportion of certain dues levied in each of its
jurisdictions; 2ᵒ. In fines and penalties adjudged to the fund by
the tribunals and the commissions of arbitration in the agricultural
districts; 3ᵒ. In ¼% of all goods and effects sold by public
auction in the country; 4ᵒ. In the interest on capital belonging
to the fund.</p>

<p>This fund has been established for the following purposes:&mdash;1ᵒ.
Of contributing to the support of paupers who, although not
properly belonging to the poor of the district in which they have
become distressed, must still be relieved; 2ᵒ. Of assisting the
parochial fund in extraordinary cases; 3ᵒ. Of defraying all expenses
of a general nature that ought to be assessed upon the
several parish funds within the jurisdiction of the bailiwick.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
these institutions.</div>

<p>With respect to the effects of these institutions
the evidence is not consistent. Mr. Macgregor’s
opinion is, on the whole, favourable.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Be the management (he says) of the poor-laws good or bad,
yet the system itself seems to have answered an important object,
that of checking the rapid growth of pauperism. I admit that
paupers have increased in Denmark these last thirty years, in the
same proportion with the increase of population (<i>pari passu</i>);
but I am far from believing that the proportion which they bear
to the whole population is <i>much</i> greater now than it was in 1803,
namely, 1:32, although some of the townships, from particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
circumstances, may form an exception. I have diligently perused
all the different reports that have been published for the last five
years upon the present state of the rural economy of the country,
and they all concur in stating that there is a slight improvement
in the value of land; that idle people are seldom found; and that
there is sufficient work in which to employ the labouring population.&mdash;(p. 291.)</p>

<p>Pauperism is chiefly confined (especially in the country) to the
class of day-labourers, both mechanic and agricultural, who, when
aged and decrepit, or burdened with large families, throw themselves
upon parish relief whenever they are distressed from sickness
or from some other casualty. But happily the allowance-system,
which is productive of so much mischief, is not acted
upon here to the same enormous extent as in England, and as the
able-bodied can expect nothing beyond the <i>absolute</i> necessaries
of life, they have no inducement for remaining idle, and they
return to work the moment they are able, and have the chance of
obtaining any. Relief, therefore, or the expectation of it, has
hitherto not been found to produce any sensible effect upon the
<i>industry</i> of labourers generally, nor upon their <i>frugality</i>, although
it is more than probable that any relaxation in the management of
the system would stimulate them to spend all their earnings in
present enjoyment, and render them still more improvident than
they already are. Nor are the poor-laws instrumental in promoting
early marriages among the peasants; but it being their
custom to form engagements at a very early period of life, this,
in the absence of all moral restraint in the intercourse between
the two sexes, leads to another serious evil, <i>bastardy</i>, which has
so much increased of late years, that out of <i>ten</i> children, <i>one</i> is
illegitimate.</p>

<p>A pauper in this kingdom lives in a state of degradation and
dependence; he only receives what is absolutely necessary for his
subsistence, and must often have recourse to fraud and imposition
to obtain that, what is reluctantly given.</p>

<p>The working labourer, on the other hand, enjoys a certain
degree of freedom and independence, although his means may be
small, and that sometimes he may even be subject to great privations.</p>

<p>Should it ever so happen that the labouring population readily
submit to all the restrictions imposed upon them by the parish
officers, and that this is found not to be owing to any transitory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
causes, such as a single year of distress or sickness, <i>then</i>, in my
humble opinion, the time is arrived and no other remedy left to
correct the evil than for the government to promote emigration.
(p. 292.)</p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Thaloman states that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Hitherto these institutions have had a salutary and beneficial
effect on the nation, inasmuch as many thousand individuals have
been prevented from strolling about as beggars, and many thousand
children have received a good education, and have grown
up to be useful and orderly citizens. Neither as yet have any
remarkable symptoms of dissatisfaction appeared among the wealthier
classes. But we cannot be without some apprehension for
the future, since the poor-rates have been augmented to such a
degree that it would be very difficult to collect larger contributions
than those now paid. And as sufficient attention has not
been paid to this circumstance, that the farmers are continually
building small cottages, in which poor people establish themselves,
since the government have been unwilling to throw any
restraint on marriages between poor persons; there seems reason
to fear, that in the lapse of another period of twenty years, the
poor in many districts will to such a degree have multiplied their
numbers, that the present system will yield no adequate means
for their support.</p>

<p>In the towns much embarrassment is already felt, the poor
having increased in them to a much greater extent than in the
country.</p>

<p>All the taxes of a considerable merchant of Dram in Norway,
who owns eight trading vessels actually employed, amounted during
last year to not more than the school and poor-rates of one
large farm in the heath district which you visited last year.
(p. 279.)</p>

</div>

<p>M. N. N., a correspondent of Mr. Browne’s, and
the author of a very detailed account of the existing
law, after stating that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Benevolent as the Danish poor system will appear, it is generally
objected to it that the too great facility of gaining admittance,
particularly to the third class, encourages sloth and indolence,
especially in the country, where the means are wanted to establish
workhouses, the only sure way of controlling those supported:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>And that,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is further objected to the present system, that it already
begins to fall too heavy on the contributors, and that in course of
time, with the constant increase of population, it will go on to
press still more severely on them, inasmuch as their number and
means do not by any means increase in a ratio equal to the augmentation
of the number wanting support: (p. 274.)</p>

</div>

<p>Adds, in answer to more specific inquiries,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Before the introduction of the present poor law system, the
distress was much greater, and begging of the most rapacious and
importunate kind was quite common in the country. This was
not only a heavy burthen on the peasantry, but was in other
respects the cause of intolerable annoyance to them; for the beggars,
when their demands were not satisfied, had recourse to
insolence and threats, nay, even to acts of criminal vengeance.
This is no longer the case, and <i>in so far</i>, therefore, the present
system has been beneficial.</p>

<p>It is a fact that poverty now appears in less striking features than
it did before the introduction of the poor law system. This may,
however, proceed from causes with which that system has no connexion;
for example, from the increased wealth of the country in
general, from improvements in agriculture, from the large additions
made to the quantity of arable land, which have been in a
ratio greatly exceeding that of the increased population. If the
clergyman, who is, and will always be the leading member of the
poor committee, was able to combine with his other heavy duties,
a faithful observance of the rules prescribed for him in the management
of the poor, I am of opinion that the system would
neither be a tax on industry nor a premium on indolence. But
it rarely happens that the clergyman can bestow the requisite
attention on the discharge of this part of his duty; and therefore
it is not to be denied that the present poor law (not from any
defect inherent in the system, but merely from faulty management)
does occasionally act as a tax on industry and a premium
on idleness. (p. 275.)</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Browne thus replies to
the questions as to the effects of the poor laws on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
the, 1. industry, 2. frugality, 3. period of marriage,
and 4. social affections of the labouring
classes, and on the comparative condition of the
pauper and the independent labourer. (pp. 266,
267.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. On the industry of the labourers?&mdash;On their industry, most
injurious, involving the levelling principle to a very great degree,
lowering the middleman to the poor man, and the poor man who
labours to the pauper supported by the parish. It tends to harden
the heart of the poor man, who demands with all that authority
with which the legal right to provision invests him. There is no
thankfulness for what is gotten, and what is given is afforded
with dislike and reluctance.</p>

<p>2. On their frugality?&mdash;The poor laws greatly weaken the
frugal principle.</p>

<p>3. On the age at which they marry?&mdash;Encourage early and
thoughtless marriages. The children are brought up with the
example of indolence and inactivity before their eyes, which must
be most prejudicial in after-life. I have often remarked amongst
the people, who are naturally soft, susceptible and sympathizing,
an extraordinary insensibility towards those who voluntarily
relieve them, even at the moment of relief, and no gratitude whatever
afterwards. I can attribute this most undesirable state of
feeling, so contrary to what might be expected from the natural
character of the people, solely to the perpetual association of right
to relief. Thus does the system always disturb and often destroy
the moral and kindly relation which should subsist and which is
natural, between the higher and lower orders. The poor man
becomes stiff and sturdy; the rich man indifferent to the wants
and sufferings of the poor one. He feels him a continual pressure,
at moments inconvenient to relieve, and under circumstances
where he would often withhold if he could, partly from dislike to
the compulsory principle, and often not regarding the case as one
of real charity, and disapproving, as he naturally may, of the
whole system of poor laws’ administration. From all I have
observed, I feel persuaded (and I have lived a good deal in the
country, having had much connexion with the lower orders, and
not having been indifferent to their condition either moral or
physical) that a more mischievous system could not have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
devised&mdash;that poverty has been greatly increased by weakening
the springs of individual effort, and destroying independence of
character&mdash;that the lower orders have become tricky, sturdy and
unobliging, the higher orders cold and uncharitable; and in short,
that ere long, unless some strenuous steps are taken, Denmark
will drink deep of the bitter cup of which England, by a similar
system, has been so long drinking to her grievous cost. Were
there no other objection, the machinery is wanting to conduct so
delicate and complicated a system. And were it the best possible,
and had the managers no other occupation but the one, the ingenuity
of idleness to escape from action is so great, that it would
often, very often, defeat eyes less actively open to detect it. I
have spoken with few who do not object to the system from first
to last, or who do not press an opinion that the state of the population
before the existence of the poor laws was more desirable by
far than at present.</p>

<p>4. On the mutual dependence and affection of parent, children,
and other relatives?&mdash;No doubt it materially disturbs the natural
dependence and affection of parent and child. The latter feels
his parent comparatively needless to him; he obtains support
elsewhere; and the former feels the obligation to support the
latter greatly diminished. In short, being comparatively independent
of each other, the affections must inevitably become
blunted.</p>

<p>5. What, on the whole, is the condition of the able-bodied and
self-supporting labourer of the lowest class, as compared with the
condition of the person subsisting on alms or public charity; is
the condition of the latter, as to food and freedom from labour,
more or less eligible?&mdash;Were I a Danish labourer, I would endeavour
to live partly on my own labour, and partly on the parish,
and I feel persuaded that a labourer so living in Denmark will be
better off than one who gets no help from the parish; that is, the
former, from a knowledge that he may fall back on the parish,
will spend all he earns at the time on coffee, spirits, tobacco,
snuff, &amp;c., whereas the latter, who certainly can live on his
industry (except under extraordinary and occasional emergencies,
sickness, &amp;c.) is debarred from such gratifications. Under such
circumstances, the <i>poorer</i> labourer is better off than the <i>poor</i> one.</p>

</div>

<p>And his views are supported by the following
observations of Count Holstein:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>1st. The dread of poverty is diminished, and he who is half-poor
works less instead of more, so that he speedily becomes a complete
pauper. Those who are young and capable of labour are
less economical, always having the poor rate in view, as a resource
against want; likewise marriages are contracted with much less
forethought, or consideration as to consequences.</p>

<p>2d. The morality of the poor man suffers, for he looks upon his
provision as a right, for which he, therefore, need not be thankful;
and, 3d, the morality of the rich man suffers, for the natural
moral relation between him and the poor man has become completely
severed; there is no place left for the exercise of his benevolence;
being obliged to give, he does it with reluctance, and
thus is the highest principle of charitable action, Christian love,
exposed to great danger of destruction.</p>

<p>4th. As the clergyman of the parish is the president of the poor
committee, he becomes involved in transactions peculiarly unsuited
to his sacred calling, sometimes even compelled to resort to the
extremity of distraint to compel his own parishioners to pay the
allotted proportions; and thus does the moral influence of him,
who should be a picture of the God of love, become every day less
and less powerful. (p. 276.)</p>

</div>

<p>We have entered into this full statement of the
Danish poor laws, and of their administration,
because they exhibit the most extensive experiment
that has as yet been made in any considerable
portion of the Continent of a system in many respects
resembling our own.</p>

<hr />

<h3>MECKLENBURG.</h3>

<p>The following passage, at the conclusion of M.
Meyen’s report, gives a short summary of the
poor laws of Mecklenburg: (p. 424.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Every inhabitant is obliged to pay certain poor rates, with the
exception of military men, up to a certain rank, students, clerks
in counting-houses and shops, assistant artisans and servants.</p>

<p>When the crown lands are let, there is always a clause in the
contract, to regulate what the farmer, the dairy farmer, the smith
and the shepherd, are to give. A day labourer pays 8<i>d.</i> yearly.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
<p>The inhabitants of higher situation and public officers pay voluntarily.
They ought to pay one per cent. of their income. If
any one pays too little, the overseers of the poor rates can oblige
him to pay more. The overseers are chosen by the inhabitants
of the district.</p>

<p>In the towns all inhabitants pay a voluntary subscription; it
ought to be one per cent. of their income. If they pay too little,
the overseers can demand more. The overseers are chosen by
the magistrate.</p>

<p>With respect to estates belonging to private individuals, the
subsistence of the poor falls entirely to the charge of the proprietor,
who is entitled to levy a trifling tax from all the inhabitants
of the estate, equal to a simple contribution amounting to
8<i>d.</i> for a day labourer per annum, and 4<i>d.</i> for a maid servant.
Few proprietors, however, levy such a tax.</p>

<p>Every one has a legal claim to assistance, and there are to
be distinguished,</p>

<p>1st. Able-bodied persons. Work and a dwelling <i>must</i> be
provided for them; the former at the usual rate, in
order not to render them quite destitute, if through
chicane work should be denied to them.</p>

<p>2d. People, impotent through age, must perform such work
as they are capable of, and so much must be given to
them that they can live upon it, besides a dwelling
and fuel.</p>

</div>

<hr />

<h3>PRUSSIA.</h3>

<p>There is some difficulty in reconciling Mr. Abercrombie’s
report and Mr. Gibsone’s. The following
is Mr. Abercrombie’s statement: (pp. 425,
426.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Throughout the whole kingdom of Prussia, the funds for the
maintenance and support of the poor are raised from private
charity. No law exists enabling either the government of the
country, or the subordinate provincial regencies, to raise funds
explicitly appropriated for the provision of the poor, and it is
only when private charity does not suffice for the exigencies of
the moment, that the government, or the regency, advance money
for that purpose. But to enable them to do so, the amount must
be taken from those funds which had been destined for other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
purposes, such as, for improvements in paving, lighting, or for
the public buildings of a town, or for the construction of roads,
or other public works.</p>

<p>In Prussia, each town, and each commune, is obliged to take
charge of the poor that may happen to reside within them; and
consequently there is no passing from one parish to another, or
refusal to maintain an individual because he belongs to another
parish.</p>

<p>In each town there is a deputation (called armen-direction) or
society for the poor, who undertake the collection and distribution
of funds raised by charity. In small towns, of under 3,500 inhabitants,
exclusive of military, this society is composed of the burgomaster,
together with the town deputies (forming the town senate)
and burghers chosen from the various quarters of the town.</p>

<p>In large and middle-sized towns, including from 3,500 to
10,000 inhabitants, exclusive of military, to the afore-mentioned
individuals is always added the syndic (or town accomptant),
and if necessary, another magistrate. Clergymen and doctors
are likewise included in the society; and where the police of the
place has a separate jurisdiction from the magistrate, the president
of the police has always a seat as a member of the society.</p>

<p>Under this armen-direction the care of the poor is confided to
different sub-committees formed of the burghers, and for this
purpose the town is divided into poor districts (or armenbezirke).
In small and middle-sized towns, these districts are again divided
into sub-districts, containing not above 1,000, or less than 400
souls. In large towns the sub-districts are to comprise not above
1,500, or less than 1,000 souls; and in these last towns several
sub-districts may, if requisite, be united into one poor district or
armenbezirke.</p>

<p>From each armenbezirke must be elected one or more of the
town deputies, or burghers, according to necessity, for the
management of the affairs of the poor; and it is also required
that at least one of those elected should be a member of the
society for the poor (or armen-direction), and these individuals
are required to find out and verify the condition of the poor of
their own district.</p>

<p>The direction of the affairs of the poor is therefore, as thus
established, confided entirely to the burghers of the town, and
the provision of the funds rests upon the charity and benevolence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p>As regards hospitals and public charities, one or more of the
members of the armen-direction undertake to watch that the funds
are expended according to the provisions made by the founders.</p>

<p>In the villages, the direction of the funds for the poor is confided
to the mayor (or schûltze), assisted by individuals chosen
for that purpose from amongst the principal inhabitants of the
commune.</p>

<p>This body is accountable to the councillor of the district (or
land rath), who is in like manner under the jurisdiction of the
provincial regency, and the whole is under the inspection of the
1st section of the home department.</p>

<p>I have now specified the authorities who control the maintenance
for the poor, and who are likewise charged with the care
of administering to their wants.</p>

<p><i>As regards the manner of obtaining the necessary funds,
everything is done by donations and private charity. Each
house proprietor, each inhabitant of a floor or apartment, is in
his turn visited by some of the members of the sub-committee of
the armenbezirke, who, in return for the donation, deliver a
receipt for the amount.</i></p>

<p><i>The donations from residents are generally monthly, and vary
in amount according to the number of individuals in the family,
or to the feelings of generosity of the donor. No rate or calculated
fixed table exists, regulating the sum to be given by each individual
or head of a family.</i></p>

<p>Each town being governed by its own particular laws and customs
with regard to the management of its poor, and each from
accidental circumstances differing from its neighbour, it is impossible
to particularize any other general principle that is followed,
than the establishments of the armen-direction, and of the
sub-committees; which detailed information I have extracted as
above from the Städte Ordnüng, or town laws, as revised in 1831.</p>

<p>As regards the practical working of this system, I have no hesitation
in affirming, that it is found universally to succeed; that
the effect upon the comfort, character, and condition of the inhabitants,
is, first, to afford speedy and sufficient means of relief
when necessary; that it prevents in a great degree false applications,
inasmuch as that the districts being small, the really needy
are more easily discovered; and secondly, that as no tax is fixed
for the maintenance of the poor, it renders all classes more willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and anxious to assist, according to their respective means,
in sustaining the funds required for the support of the poor.
(p. 426.)</p>

</div>

<p>On the other hand, the following is the statement
of Mr. Gibsone: (pp. 460, 461, 463, 464.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>In general it is the duty of the police authority in every community,
where any person in distress may come, to render him
the needful assistance for the moment, which must be repaid,</p>

<p><i>a</i>) by the provincial pauper fund, if the person be a foreigner,
or have no domicile; or,</p>

<p><i>b</i>) by the community, or owner of the estate (called the
dominium), he belongs to, if a native of the country.</p>

<h4><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h4>

<p>Every pretended needy person is duly examined by a medical
man, whether he be bodily and mentally able to maintain himself
(it is the same with families) by work, and in this case he is
required by the police to do so, and to conduct himself properly.
Any one who does not, is sent to the poor-and-workhouse (the
work is compulsive) of the province, where he is taught to earn
a livelihood. If the distress be temporary, the proprietor of the
estate (called the dominium), or the community in which the
indigent person has acquired a settlement, is bound to afford the
requisite relief; yet having the right to claim restitution, upon
the assisted person becoming able to make it. When this is not
the case, and the relief has been afforded by a community, the
members of it must bear the expense, if in a town, out of its
general funds; if in the country, in the proportions they pay the
land-tax to the king, called war-contribution. The support is
rendered in giving a dwelling, (with a garden, if in the country),
fuel, salt, money, &amp;c., wholly or partly, sometimes by boarding
the pauper, according to the necessity of the case.</p>

<p>There is in every province a poor-and-workhouse (the work
compulsive), for receiving the following persons:</p>

<p><i>a</i>) such as have indeed a fixed place of abode in the country,
yet seek their livelihood by begging, although able
to work;</p>

<p><i>b</i>) actual paupers, who receive a fixed maintenance or aid
from communities, benevolent institutions, &amp;c., yet, notwithstanding,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
wander about the country begging;</p>

<p><i>c</i>) invalid soldiers, found begging, as every soldier who has
been rendered invalid in war enjoys a pension from the
state (a very small one);</p>

<p><i>d</i>) travelling handicraftsmen, as none are permitted to travel
in their profession who have not the means of subsistence,
or are above 30 years old;</p>

<p><i>e</i>) foreign vagabonds, until they can be transported over the
borders;</p>

<p><i>f</i>) those who have been punished for crime, in the fortress
or house of correction, and after expiration of their
term of punishment, are unable to show how they can
earn an honest livelihood;</p>

<p><i>g</i>) such as by particular sentences are, or by future laws
may be, declared subjects for the compulsive workhouse.</p>

<p>It is left to every proprietor of an estate (called the dominium),
to every town and village community, to provide and select, at
their option, a livelihood for those individuals, having a settlement
under their jurisdiction, who cannot procure such for themselves.
<i>Should a proprietor of an estate, or a community, not
fulfil this obligation, it is compelled to do so, but which seldom is
necessary.</i></p>

<p>It is to be observed, that when, from bad crops, inundations,
&amp;c., a general scarcity occurs in particular parts of the country,
works of public utility, such as turnpike-roads, drains, and the
like, are ordered by government, in order to afford the inhabitants
the means of subsistence, which work is paid for with
money, grain, salt, or other articles, as most suitable, according
to circumstances.</p>

<p><i>No person, able-bodied or capable of earning a livelihood, has
a legal claim for support, but he can only, when misfortune
befals him, receive a temporary aid in the way of an advance.</i>
For further answers to this question, see the preceding answers.</p>

<p>All children capable of going to school are obliged to attend it.
Those whose parents are unable to pay the expense, must be sent
thither at the cost of the community to which they belong, which
must also do the needful for clothing, feeding, educating, and
apprenticing them. Such children also frequently receive assistance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
from private benevolent societies and individuals.</p>

<h4><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h4>

<p>In the towns, the community must provide for all the absolute
wants of the poor out of the municipal funds, and in every town a
board is established for directing the management of these
affairs.</p>

<p>In the country, the proprietors of the estates, or the village
authorities, must provide for these wants, for which, in the latter
case, the members of the village community must contribute in
the proportions as they pay the taxes to the king, say the land-tax,
called war contribution.</p>

<p>In Dantzig, the poor, besides being placed in the poor-house,
or, otherwise assisted, receive alms at their homes from a charitable
society of the citizens, whose funds arise partly from private
contributions, and partly from an annual supply out of the
municipal funds. From this society about 1000 persons
yearly receive support (about one-third males and two-thirds females),
but not above about 3<i>s.</i> to 4<i>s.</i>, and not under 1<i>s.</i> monthly,
for the time the support is required. In winter, when severe,
they get also firing, partly in fir-wood, but chiefly in turf.
The sum thus disbursed is now considerably less than before,
from the control on the part of the magistracy being much
stricter. The whole annual expense of the society is about 1200<i>l.</i>
sterling.</p>

<h4><i>Sick.</i></h4>

<p>The law prescribes that every town and every village community
must support its own members when in distress, provided
there be no relations able to do so, and the owners of estates are
under a similar obligation; hence the sick stand under the same
regulations as the impotent through age.</p>

<h4><i>Effects of the foregoing Institutions.</i></h4>

<p>The regulations for the support of paupers operate beneficially
on industry. Every proprietor of an estate, every community of
a town or village has unquestionably the most correct knowledge
of the bodily condition, of the moral conduct, of the expertness,
of the capability to earn a livelihood in whole or in
part, and of the pecuniary circumstances of the needy persons
under their jurisdiction, whom they are bound to support, as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
as of the circumstances of their relatives. The pauper knows
that aid must always be given when necessary, <i>and he applies to
the proper authority for it, when not duly afforded</i>; while he is,
on the other hand, deterred from making exorbitant claims by
his situation being so thoroughly known in every respect, and
from ungrounded demands not being complied with. In general,
therefore, neither the party called upon for assistance, nor that
requiring it, inclines to let the authority interpose, but an
amicable arrangement usually takes place between them, according
to existing circumstances. The pauper must perform what
service or work he can for those who assist him, or for himself,
towards contributing to his own support as far as in his
power; while those rendering assistance can seek only in themselves
the means to do so, of course in the least expensive and
most suitable manner. The paupers are employed at various
kinds of work and service, accordingly as such is wanted and as
they are able to perform it, and this as well for their supporters,
privately, as in the public workhouses.</p>

<p>It is, in general, to be observed that the right of settlement of
individuals is established in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>If any person acquires the right of citizenship in a town, or a
possession (house or lying-ground) in the country, or if he is
permitted by the local authority to form a regular domicile by
becoming a householder, he then is considered as an expressly
accepted member of the community, and the obligation to support
him, when reduced to want, immediately commences. So soon,
therefore, as any person shows an intention to settle, or to
become a householder, in a place, it is the business of the community,
or of those interested, to ascertain, through the medium
of the proper local authority, whether or not the emigrant possesses
sufficient means to maintain himself there. Should this
not be the case, and he is evidently unable to earn a livelihood,
then must the support of the individual (or family) be borne by
the community where he has previously dwelt, and it is not
advisable to permit the change of domicile. Thence is the rule
justified, that upon any person being regularly received as member
of a community, with the express consent of its magistracy, that
community becomes bound to render him support, when his
situation requires it. Minors belong to the community in which
their parents were settled, even after the death of these. With
regard to other inhabitants, only that town or village community<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
is bound to maintain a pauper where he last contributed to its
public burthens.</p>

<p>A person who is of age, and has resided three succeeding years
in a place (for instance, as servant,) acquires by that the right of
settlement, but which he again loses by leaving the place for one
year. Privileged corporations, that possess a particular poor-fund,
or raise among themselves, pursuant to their laws, the
means to provide for their needy members, are specially bound to
maintain them.</p>

<p>In conformity with the rules before stated, must also the
wives, widows, and destitute children of paupers be supported
by the communities or corporations, or the owners of the
estates.</p>

<p>Paupers for whom communities, corporations, proprietors of
estates, or relatives are not bound to provide, according to the
foregoing rules, or when these are unable to do so, have to be
maintained in provincial poor and workhouses. These are established
at the expense of government, and supported by contributions
from the whole province.</p>

</div>

<p>We are inclined to suspect that the practice
corresponds with Mr. Abercrombie’s account, and
the general law with Mr. Gibsone’s, and that the
pauper possesses a legal right to assistance, though
that right is seldom enforced, because the impotent
are voluntarily provided for, and the able-bodied
would probably be sent to a penal workhouse. It
is probable indeed that the law itself is vague as
respects the relief of the able-bodied. The difficulty
in framing a poor-law, of either expressly admitting
or expressly rejecting their claim, is such that
almost all who have legislated on the subject have
left their legal right undecided. Mr. Gibsone’s
statement, that no person able-bodied <i>or</i> capable of
earning a livelihood has a legal claim for support, is
inconsistent with his general account of the law,
unless we change <i>or</i> into <i>and</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAXONY.</h3>

<p>But little information has been received from
Saxony.</p>

<p>Some of the modes in which relief is administered
appear, as they are nakedly stated in the Report, to
be liable to great abuse. We are told that persons
receive from the parishes to which they belong
assistance in proportion to their inability to maintain
themselves; that a sum is fixed as necessary to
support a man, and that if he cannot earn the
whole, the difference is given to him as relief; and
that with respect to lodging, the parish interferes
in cases where ejectment takes place on account of
non-payment of house-rent, and guarantees payment
for a short time to those who agree to receive the
houseless (p. 479). These customs, as they are
mentioned, resemble the worst forms of English mal-administration,&mdash;allowance
and payment of rent.</p>

<p>Mr. Forbes, however, states that more relief than
is strictly necessary is never given; and that it has
been the steady determination of every government
to render the situation of those receiving parochial
relief too irksome for it to proceed from any other
than the merest necessity. It is probable, therefore,
that a strict administration prevents the customs
which have been mentioned from being sufficiently
prevalent to produce what have been their consequences
with us.</p>

<hr />

<h3>WURTEMBERG.</h3>

<p>The information respecting Wurtemberg is remarkably
full and precise, having been collected
with great care by Sir Edward Disbrowe and Mr.
Wellesley, assisted by the provincial authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and the government.</p>

<p>The kingdom of Wurtemberg consists of about
8000 square English miles, inhabited by 1,578,000
persons, being about 200 persons to a square mile.
It is divided into 64 bailiwicks, which are subdivided
into civil communities or parishes, containing
each not less than 500 individuals. Each parish
constitutes a separate corporation, and the parishes
in each bailiwick also constitute one superior corporation.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the parishes appears to
possess a fund called <i>pium corpus</i>, arising partly
from voluntary contribution and other casual receipts,
but principally from funds which previously
to the Reformation had been employed for the
purposes of the Roman Catholic worship, and instead
of being confiscated by the government, as
was the case in England, were directed to be employed
for charitable purposes.</p>

<p>Many of them also have almshouses, or, as they
are called in the Reports, hospitals for the residence
of the poor, and other endowments for their use;
and almost all possess an estate called an allemand,
which is the joint property of the persons for the
time being having bürgerrecht, or the right of
citizenship in the parish, and is, together with the
<i>pium corpus</i> and endowments, the primary fund for
the relief of the poor. Subject to the claims of the
poor, the allemand is divided among the bürghers,
without reference to their wealth or their wants,
but apparently in equal proportion to each head of
a family, and enjoyed in severalty, but inalienably,
either for life or for a shorter period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir E. Disbrowe states (p. 485) that the government
of the parish is vested in the mayor and a
certain number of counsellors for life (who appear
to be appointed by the government), and an equal
number of representatives chosen by the bürghers,
half of whom go out by rotation every second year.</p>

<p>About nine-tenths of the population appear to be
bürghers; the remainder are called beisitzers or
settled non-freemen, and differ from the bürghers
by having no claim on the allemand, or vote in the
election of the parochial authorities.</p>

<p>Bürgerrecht is obtained by inheritance, or by
purchase at a sum regulated by law, but varying
according to the allemand and the population of
each parish.</p>

<p>It is lost by emigration or misconduct. 1st, A
person who has lost his bürgerrecht is entitled to
purchase that right in the parish in which he formerly
possessed it: a person who never possessed
that right is entitled to purchase it; 2dly, In the
parish in which he spent the last five years. In
default of this claim, 3dly, in the parish in which
he obtained his marriage license. 4thly, If unmarried,
in the parish in which he was born; or
5thly, if he have none of these claims, in the parish
to which the police thinks fit to assign him. If
he cannot or will not pay the requisite purchase-money,
he is bound by payment of half the previous
sum to constitute himself a beisitzer, and has similar
claims to admission as a beisitzer. If he cannot
pay this sum he is assigned by the police to a
parish, as a beisitzer, without payment.</p>

<p>Having given this outline of the mode in which
the population is distributed, we proceed to state,
from the report furnished by the government, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
degree and mode in which the poor are relieved.
(Pages 524, 525, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542,
543, 547.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>39. He who cannot derive the necessaries of life either from
his property, his labour, or his trade, nor be supported by his
nearest relations and other persons bound to it by private right,
has a claim on the support of the (political or civil) <i>community</i> in
which he has the right of a burgher or of a beisitzer.</p>

<p>In times of particular distress, not only those who are absolutely
poor, but those also who are indeed not without property,
but, by the unfavourable circumstances of the times, are rendered
incapable of providing the necessaries of life for themselves and
their children, have a right to require, from the communities of
which they are members, the necessary support. Thus, in the
year of scarcity in 1817, the spiritual and temporal overseers of
the communities were expressly made responsible by the government,
that none of those who were confided to their superintendence
and care should be exposed to suffer want; with the
threat, that if, for want of care on the part of the overseers, any
person should perish, the guilty should be prosecuted with all the
rigour of the law.</p>

<p>If a person belonging to one or more communities has need of
public support, the share to be borne by each is determined by the
government authorities, having respect to the merely personal or
family connexion with the several communities.</p>

<p>Each of the three religious persuasions prevailing in the kingdom
has the full enjoyment of its poor fund. Poor members of
the community, however, who belong to a religious persuasion
different to that which prevails in the place, cannot be denied the
necessary relief from the poor fund of the place, on account of
the difference of religion.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Bailiwick Corporations.</i></h4>

<p>40. If a community has so many poor, or is so limited in its
resources, that it is not in a condition properly to support its poor,
the <i>other communities of the bailiwick, particularly the towns, so
far as they are better able, and have few or no poor</i>, are bound
by the law to assist such a poor community with their alms. A
general obligation of the bailiwick corporation to assist those
communities of the bailiwicks which are not able to afford the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
necessary assistance to their poor inhabitants, is not ordained by
the laws, unless such assistance is to the interest of the bailiwick
corporation as such.</p>

<p>In the year 1817, however, the bailiwick corporations were
enjoined, so long as the dearth lasted, and with reference to old
laws, in case single communities should be unable sufficiently
to provide for all the inhabitants, to give them credit so far
as to answer either partly or entirely for the debt, but always
with the reservation of repayment by the receivers of the aid.
And with respect to the support of the poor, which are assigned
to a community, it is expressly ordered, that if the assignment is
founded on one of the titles to a right of settlement enumerated
under 1, 2, and 3<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>, the community against which the right is
established is to bear only one-third, and the whole of the bailiwick
the other two-thirds; but if the assignment is founded on one of
the other titles, the whole bailiwick has to take upon itself this
support. The expense which is hereby incurred by a bailiwick,
constitutes an object of what is called <i>amtsvergleichung</i>, and is
imposed on the whole old and now rateable <i>cadastre</i> of the
bailiwick.</p>

<h4><i>Of the Duty of the State.</i></h4>

<p>41. The public Exchequer affords, partly on account of the
previous sequestration of the church property, and of some other
funds and revenues destined for pious and charitable purposes, and
partly without any such special legal ground, contributions for the
foundation and support of various public beneficent institutions,
and it sometimes assists single bailiwicks, communities, and individuals
in particular cases, by contributions for charitable purposes.
But a general obligation of the public Exchequer to
intervene, in case of the inability of the communities or bailiwicks,
is no where enacted in the laws of Wurtemberg, and is also not
recognised by the government, because too great liberality on its
part, and the grant of a distinct head of expenditure for this purpose,
as in general the transferring of local burthens to the public
exchequer, might lead to very extensive consequences, and might
gradually give rise to always increasing claims, which, in the
impossibility of ranging single cases under general points of view,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
it might not be always possible successfully to meet.</p>

<h4><i>Amount of Relief to the Poor.</i></h4>

<p>42. What is <i>necessary</i> for a poor person or a poor family, and
how much such a person or family may require for their <i>necessary
support</i>, is not expressed in the laws of Wurtemberg; on the contrary,
the answer to this question is left to the judgment of the
magistrate in every particular case. In fact, it is not well susceptible
of a general answer, because the wants of men are so
very different, according to their constitutions and inclinations,
and the means of satisfying these wants depend too much on
personal, local, and temporary circumstances.</p>

<h4><i>Support and Employment of the Adult Poor.</i></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Relief of
the able-bodied
out-doors.</div>

<p>75. With respect to the adult poor, it is enacted by our oldest
laws, that such grown-up poor who would willingly work, but
cannot find employment, <i>shall</i>, as far as possible, <i>have means
found them by the magistrates</i> to earn a livelihood by their
labour; but that lazy idlers who are strong and healthy <i>shall be
compelled to work</i>; and, according to a recent ordinance, the
able-bodied who claim support from the public funds are bound to
take any work for which they have adequate strength, whether it
be public or private, which is assigned to them by the local overseers,
receiving for it proportionate moderate wages. If they
refuse to do the work assigned them, and cannot allege that they
can earn something by other work, or produce some other excuse,
the overseer is authorized to employ towards them means of compulsion.</p>

<p>According to old laws, poor persons who still have a house and
lands, or at least some little portions of land, and who have suffered
by failure of the crops, frost, &amp;c., or who cannot sow their
lands, or are unable to dispose of them without great loss, but are
still able to work, and have hopes of retrieving their losses in the
harvest and autumn, shall be assisted by the communities, which,
according as the case may be, shall lend to them from the public
fund a sufficient sum, to be repaid as they may be able to do it in
course of time, or shall at least give security for them.</p>

<p>The laws also order that in public works which the communities
have executed by daily labourers, able-bodied poor who have a claim
to support from the public funds shall be employed in preference.
In places where the hospitals have lands of their own, and farm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
them on their own account, poor persons are also employed in
preference, at suitable wages.</p>

<p>Not only in the year of scarcity, 1817, and subsequently, many
adult poor have been employed at suitable wages on the public
account in other hard work, such as forest labours, planting trees,
cultivating waste lands, turf-digging, working in the quarries, lime-pits,
or excavating for antiquities, pulling down old buildings,
cutting down avenues of old trees, levelling ground, laying out
new public walks or churchyards, draining marshes, cleaning
common sewers and streets, working at bridges, roads, and
canals, &amp;c.</p>

<p>79. According to the ancient laws, the communities are bound
to advance money on loan according to the ability of the poor
fund, and to the circumstances of the persons, to poor mechanics
who cannot begin or carry on their trade, without assistance, which
sum they are to repay as they may be able to do in time.</p>

<p>81. But the indirect support of the poor by employment and
loans has, however, its limits.</p>

<p>The extraordinary expense incurred in 1817, for <i>public works</i>,
was indeed justified at that time by the extraordinary distress; but
for the constant prosecution of such works, there would be wanting,
in most places, occasion and opportunity, and at all events the
necessary means; nor could the communities well be expected,
merely for the sake of employing the poor, to have such works
done by them if they are not absolutely necessary, or at least
urgently required at the moment, or if they could be performed at
a cheaper rate by contract or by statute labour.</p>

<p>In many places there is not always an opportunity to obtain
work for daily wages, with private persons, especially in winter,
and for women and children; or at least the wages at different
times of the year, and for many kinds of work, are too small to
support a family, and when public institutions for giving employment
are in question, great prudence is necessary, that while one
person is provided with work and wages, another may not find the
source of gain interrupted or cut off by which he has hitherto
obtained a livelihood without the assistance of the magistrates.</p>

<p>But when due attention is paid to these very important considerations,
it is extremely difficult, in Wurtemberg at least, to find
means of employing the poor capable of work, by the intervention
of the magistrates, when they are themselves not able to obtain
suitable employment, and this difficulty must increase from year to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
year, in which the number and extent of the public institutions for
employing children increase, and as the employment of the
prisoners in the penal establishments (police and workhouses, and
houses of correction) is extended.</p>

<p>On this account, there are indeed in the capital, and in some
other places, where for the sake of the moral gain a small
pecuniary sacrifice is not regarded, particular public establishments
for employing the adult poor in spinning, and other such
work; but they nowhere extend to a whole bailiwick. Wherever
they still exist, though the poor in them are not fed and clothed,
but only employed, their support requires considerable annual aid
from public funds; and in most places the establishments formerly
opened for the employment of the adult poor have been entirely
broken up, with the exception of a part of the inhabitants of the
poor-houses (s. 91).</p>

<p>Consequently, and especially till the new institutions for the
better education of the youthful poor shall have been able to produce
their entire effect, there will still remain in Wurtemberg a
very considerable number, not only of poor unable or unwilling to
work, but also of such as are both able and willing, who cannot
be supported otherwise than directly.</p>

<p>82. In many places the local poor are, with this view, allowed
<i>themselves to collect</i> gifts in money, food, &amp;c. from the wealthier
inhabitants of the place; but in most of these places this kind of
collecting of such gifts is limited to the houses of certain of the
richer inhabitants, who have given them express permission to do
so, and to fixed days and hours, and it is likewise subject to the
superintendence of the police: but as a general rule, the poor are
prohibited from personal collecting of gifts, even in their own
place of residence. On the other hand, those poor persons in
whose cases the above-described indirect means of relief are not
applicable, or not sufficient for their necessary support, regularly
receive everywhere out of the <i>public funds of the community to
which they belong</i>, and under different names, such as alms,
gratuity, pension, board, &amp;c., partly weekly, monthly, quarterly,
or annually, partly without any fixed time, as need may be, gifts
according to the wants of the individuals relieved, and the ability
of the community, sometimes amounting to only one or a few
florins, sometimes to 20, 50, 70, and even 100 and more florins,
for each person or family in a year. With respect to the extent of
these gifts, there is nowhere any general, legal ordinance; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
the question, how much is requisite for the necessary support of
each individual or of each family, remains entirely for the consideration
of the authorities which have to give the relief.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In-door
relief.</div>

<p>67. Adult poor who, on account of their great age, or of weakness,
infirmity, and sickness of body or mind, or on account of
immoral conduct, cannot be left to themselves, and who have no
relations legally bound and able to superintend and take care of
them, and who consequently would not be sufficiently relieved
merely by a present in money or in kind, are even now, especially
in small towns, taken in by all the members of the community in
their turn, from house to house, by the day or by the week, or else
put out to board in a fixed private house at the expense of the
local funds.</p>

<p>But as nobody readily determines to admit such persons to his
table and his house, particularly persons affected with the itch and
other contagious disorders; and as even the most careful selection
of such private boarding-houses, with the best superintendence
which is possible in such cases, frequently answers neither the expectations
of those who provide such accommodation, nor the
wants of those intended to be provided, it is very fortunate that,
partly so far back as the 14th and 15th centuries,&mdash;partly in modern
and very recent times, almost in every large and small town, and
even in some villages,&mdash;partly by particular endowments for the
purpose,&mdash;partly at the expense of the local funds, a distinct public
poor-house, or even several such poor-houses, have been built, or
purchased, or taken from debtors in lieu of payment, which were
not precisely intended to provide for persons of the above description,
but rather to receive foreign vagabonds, and also for fear
of the leprosy, plague, or cholera; which establishments, founded
under various denominations, such as poor-house, beggars’-house,
hospital, lazaretto, infirmary, leprosy-house, cholera-house, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
now that the entrance of foreign vagrants is prevented, and the
fear of plague, leprosy, and cholera is past, can be made use of for
the reception of the native poor belonging to the above classes.</p>

<p>Many of these houses can, indeed, accommodate only 10, 20,
30, or 40 persons, but many of them are calculated for a hundred
or several hundred persons.</p>

<p>Formerly it was usual to receive also poor children, with or
without their parents, into these houses, but latterly the children
are otherwise disposed of, and only <i>married persons, without
children</i>, or single adult poor, are admitted, who for the most part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
are, as far as possible, kept separate according to their sex, and
partly according to other circumstances, especially as prescribed
by existing ordinances. Separate rooms for insane and sick persons,
particularly for those who have the venereal disease and the
itch, are fitted up in these poor-houses, so as to answer, as much
as possible, this particular object; and in some cases separate
buildings are allotted for this purpose.</p>

<p>90. In many of these poor-houses, those who are admitted into
them have only free lodging and firing, and sometimes clothing;
and to provide for their other wants, a weekly, monthly, or annual
allowance in money or in kind.</p>

<p>In others, they are directly provided with every thing; that is,
they have in the house free lodging, candles, firing, bedding,
clothes, food, and in case of sickness, medical care, medicine, and
attendance. In general, in this case, each of the two sexes, or a
great number of such persons, nearly of the same class, have a
<i>common sleeping-room</i>, and a <i>common eating</i> and <i>working-room</i>.
Sometimes however only two, three, or four poor persons together,
and often even individual poor have their separate rooms.</p>

<p>In the common sleeping-rooms, every person has his separate
bed, generally feather beds, such as are usually found in poor independent
families.</p>

<p>The clothing is mostly warmer and stronger, but not so good-looking
and more old-fashioned than that of the poorer independent
citizens.</p>

<p>The food consists, generally, in the morning of soup, at noon a
farinaceous dish and vegetables, and once, twice, rarely three
times in the week, of a quarter or half a pound of meat; in the
evening of soup, together with milk or potatoes. There are, however,
poor-houses where they get no breakfast in the morning; at
dinner only farinaceous food or vegetables (not both together),
and once a week only, or even but a few times in the year, on certain
holidays, or even not at all, meat, and in the evening nothing
but <i>soup</i>.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> When this diet is furnished by contract, 5, 5½, 6, 7,
8 to 8½ kreutzer daily per head are at present paid for it; besides
which, however, the contractor mostly has lodging and firing
gratis, and the use of a garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Besides this, every person receives in most of these houses, 3,
3½, 4, 5, 6, and even 7 pounds of bread weekly, and in some
places a few kreutzer every week for snuff; wine is given only
where there are special endowments for that purpose, mostly on
certain holidays. The sick have better and lighter food and wine,
as the physician thinks fit to prescribe in every case.</p>

<p>In some of these houses, more, and in others less, care is taken
that the inmates of them do not unnecessarily go out, and that
those who are able to do some work are not idle. Some hospitals
have lands which they keep in their own hands, and in this case
the inmates are employed as much as possible in assisting in the
agricultural operations. Where there is no land, they must at least
prepare the necessary firewood, carry wood and water, help in
washing, cooking, and other domestic employments; they must
spin, wind yarn, knit, sew, make clothes and shoes for the house,
&amp;c. In some poor-houses they are also employed in making
wooden pegs for shoemakers and tilers, matches, &amp;c.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, the employment of these people in the
poor-houses does not produce much.</p>

<p><i>In the year 1817, and during the dearth which prevailed at
that time, an old law which had fallen into desuetude was revived;
according to which, the rich and opulent who, after
having been previously applied to for voluntary contributions,
should not come forward in a manner suitable to their property,
are to be taxed by the magistrates in a sum conformable to their
income, and according to all the circumstances of their
situation.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The comparative situation of the pauper and the
independent labourer is thus stated at the conclusion
of the Government Report:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>If we now compare the situation of one of the poorest of the
Wurtemberg poor who support themselves independently by their
labour without external aid (<i>see</i> § 40.), with that of one of the
more favoured of the Wurtemberg poor who lives by public
charity, for instance, the inmate of an hospital, and even of a
prison, it might certainly appear that the condition of the latter
is preferable to that of the former.</p>

<p>In fact, we often see such hospital inmates, and even prisoners,
attain the most advanced age, while many a poor day-labourer
and artisan sinks at a much earlier age under the weight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of his cares and the want of necessaries. In fact, many an
inmate of an hospital, and many a prisoner, even with bodily infirmities
and sufferings, still seems to find his condition quite
comfortable, and shows himself thankful for the good which he
enjoys, while many a day-labourer or artisan, in the enjoyment of
good bodily health, feels himself miserable, and curses his
existence; in fact, many a one seeks admission into the hospital
who would be very well able to provide himself with necessaries
by his work at home. In fact, the man often separates from his
wife, or the wife from her husband, or from the children, to be received
into the hospital. In fact, many a one does not economize,
but squanders what he has, and does not work in order to earn
something, because he thinks that he always has the right of
being received into the hospital as a last resource. <i>In fact, in
many places where there are rich hospitals and other foundations,
the number of the poor is proportionably greater than in
places where less is done for their support. In fact, many a
one continues to beg and to steal, who has already been frequently
imprisoned for these offences, because he finds his
situation in the workhouse very tolerable in comparison with the
laborious life of a poor man at liberty.</i></p>

<p>However, the situation of the inmates of an hospital, even of
those which are the most liberal to their inmates, is by no means
so enviable as from the above comparison it might seem to be.
Frequently their residence is embittered by their being obliged to
live together with rude, quarrelsome, mad, silly, and disgusting
persons. Many embitter their own lives by a discontentedness,
which may either be natural to them, or communicated by others.
Many dislike the kind or the quantity of the work allotted to them,
the restrictions with respect to the time of going out and returning
home which are prescribed by the regulations of the house.
Prisoners, in particular, consider the loss of their freedom as an
intolerable burden. Besides this, too, the treatment is by no
means in general and in <i>every</i> poor-house so good as it is represented
in the above comparison; hence it is not the case with all
the poor received into a poor-house, that they have voluntarily
sought admission there, or that they voluntarily and willingly remain
in it; hence, too, the applications for admission to these
houses are not everywhere equally pressing; hence the assertion
that the existence of such houses increases the numbers of
prodigals, idlers, and poor, cannot be taken as generally correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>At all events, the above comparison applies to the actual inmates
of the hospital, rather than to those poor who are relieved
only by money and commodities, or by finding them employment;
for the relief which they receive in this manner is in most places
dealt out with so scanty a measure, that their situation is little or
not at all better than that of a healthy poor person, who maintains
himself independently by the labour of his hands, without external
assistance. The independent poor man always has the cheering
consciousness of maintaining himself and his family by his own
exertions, and of enjoying the respect of his fellow-citizens, which
is always lost in a greater or less degree by the poor man who
receives relief, to whom, in the eyes of the better classes, a kind
of disgrace attaches, which must often fall on the idle, who is
excluded from elections of the community, &amp;c., restricted in
marrying, &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>And the authors go on to express a belief that
pauperism is diminishing, and that the number of
paupers, which in 1820 amounted to 64,896, does
not now exceed 50,000, or about 1-30th of the
whole population.</p>

<p>The preference which the government reporter
appears to give to out-door relief is opposed to the
preface to the rules of the Weinsburg House of
Industry.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The former mode of providing for the wants of the poor by
weekly relief in money or in bread, by giving them clothes, or
providing them small apartments, or by paying their rent or their
board, entrained many abuses, and therefore little effected its end;
in fact, it wanted the superintendence essential to the management
of a class of men for the most part of irregular and dissipated
habits. Employment was not furnished to those who were yet in
a state to work; and there were no means of repressing mendicity
and vice.&mdash;(p. 500.)</p>

</div>

<p>The object of this establishment is said to be,</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Art. 1.&mdash;To provide a common habitation, and all other necessaries,
for all those who, whether sick or in health, need assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>Art. 2.&mdash;As far as it may be possible, to furnish them with
employment, according to their capability of work.</p>

<p>Art. 3.&mdash;Not only to provide work for those who ask for it, but
to enforce it from those who, being without property, neither engage
in trade nor in service, but endeavour to live at the expense
of others.</p>

<p class="center">2. <i>Conditions of Admission.</i></p>

<p>The persons who need assistance are, with few exceptions, men
of vicious, or careless, or improvident habits, who are now unable
to earn their bread. The old practice was, to pay their rent,
furnish them with fuel, or give them weekly allowances in money
or bread; but there was no certainty that these gifts were well
employed. For this reason, only persons worthy of assistance
are received, clothed, and fed in this institution: for, in our
country, well-disposed people, even with little talent, can always
earn their own maintenance.</p>

<p>The aged or impotent poor may be admitted at their own
request.</p>

<p>Art. 7.&mdash;The Directors of the establishment, as well as the
President of the Committee of Founders, can order the admission
of poor people if they are fully persuaded of its necessity. The
person so admitted must promise, in writing, to obey the laws of
the establishment. This admission requires to be confirmed at
the next sitting of the Committee of Founders. The same rules
apply to the admission of the indigent sick.</p>

<p>Art. 8.&mdash;<i>But in no case is this charitable institution to become
the periodical abode of persons not accustomed to a fixed trade,
or of those who will not remain with their masters, or who would
like to pass there the winter when the demand for labour is slack,
or who have wasted their summer wages by spending the earnings
of one day’s toil in two days of idleness and debauchery.</i></p>

<p>Art. 9.&mdash;<i>Whoever then is once admitted, enters the establishment
with all that he possesses, and engages himself to work and
remain there for ever.</i></p>

<p>Art. 10.&mdash;In all cases, those who enter voluntarily, as well as
those who are forced to enter, are, from the moment of admission,
considered as paupers, and whatever they possess becomes the
property of the foundation.</p>

<p>Art. 11.&mdash;In case of extraordinarily good conduct on the part
of a pauper, when there is reasonable hope that he can support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
himself, or if he wishes to enter the service of a respectable
family, the Council of Foundation may permit him to leave the
Institution. In this case his property is restored to him, after
deducting, from a person capable of work, 58f., and from one incapable
of work 88f. The expense of their residence is deducted
from the property of the sick.</p>

<p>All persons of the age of fourteen, who cannot prove that they
are in the service of a respectable family, may be forced to work
in the Institution.</p>

<p>Art. 12.&mdash;All persons of either sex, who are not in a state to
maintain themselves, either from their property or by industry,
and who become chargeable to others may be admitted; but,
before the police can require their admission, it must be shown
that they have been punished three times, either for mendicity or
theft&mdash;(p. 501.)</p>

</div>

<p>Regulations of this severity prove that the able-bodied
paupers at least are a small and degraded
class, exciting little sympathy, for whom enough is
supposed to be done if they are prevented from
starving. As far indeed as can be collected from
the Weinsberg regulations, the undeserving may be
utterly refused relief, since it does not appear that
relief is to be given out of the house, and the applications
for admission by undeserving objects are to
be rejected.</p>

<p>The actual working of the system may be best
inferred from the detailed accounts supplied by
Sir Edward Disbrowe of 18 parishes.</p>

<p>Of these four, that is Obertürkheim, Osweil,
Necker Weihingen, and Egolsheim, provide for their
poor by rates levied on all the inhabitants. During
each of four years, from 1829 to 1832 inclusive, the
persons receiving relief in Obertürkheim were three
out of a population of 842, at an annual expense of
5<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>, or about 1½<i>d.</i> per head on the whole
population. In Osweil the average number was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
eight, out of a population of 1608; average annual
expense 25<i>l.</i>, or about 3½<i>d.</i> a head. In Necker
Weihingen, of which the population is 1070, the
persons relieved were, in 1829, one man; in 1830,
one man and one woman; in 1831, one man and
one woman; and the annual expense in 1829 was
5<i>l.</i>; and in each of the years 1830 and 1831,
4<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, or about 1<i>d.</i> a head. The number relieved
in Egolsheim, of which the population is
618, is not mentioned; but it must have been very
trifling, since the average annual expense is stated
at 2<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which is less than 1<i>d.</i> per head.</p>

<p>In those places in which the relief of the poor is
wholly or principally supplied from endowments, the
annual expenditure is, as might have been expected,
much larger. But even in these it seldom amounts
to 1<i>s.</i> per head on the whole population, being
about one-twelfth of the average expenditure in
England. And in the whole bailiwick of Ludwigsberg,
containing 29,068 inhabitants, in the year
1831 only 372 persons received regular, and 371
persons irregular (and indeed merely medical)
relief. The kingdom of Wurtemberg, therefore,
appears to have been, as yet, eminently successful
in reconciling a recognition of the right to relief
with economy in its distribution.</p>

<h3>BAVARIA.</h3>

<p>With respect to the Bavarian institutions we
have little information excepting the text of the
law. The following extracts will show its general
law tendency: (pp. 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 562, 563.)</p>

<div class="blockquote"><div class="sidenote">Poor Law
authorities.</div>

<p>Each town, market, and village, is to have an institution for the
poor; but if several villages wish to unite in forming one of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
institutions, it is not only to be permitted, but every facility is to
be afforded it.</p>

<p>Each provincial district (landgericht) must have an institution of
its own.</p>

<p>All the inhabitants of such district are obliged, according to
their means, to contribute to that purpose; each person is, besides,
bound to continue to support those poor relations whom the laws
direct him to maintain.</p>

<p>The claims for relief are to be fixed according to the laws of
their district (heimath gesetz.) Sometimes, in cases of great
necessity, relief is allowed to strangers who do not belong to the
parish.</p>

<p>The overseers consist (unless it is otherwise determined) of the
directors, of the police, commissaries, and magistrates.</p>

<p>In cases where medical aid is necessary, they are to be attended
by physicians, who are appointed by the state.</p>

<p>In towns and larger market towns, besides the above-named
overseers, a council is to be formed, consisting of the clergyman
and the mayor and persons deputed by the magistrates and all
classes of the people, in proportion to the number of inhabitants
of each place.</p>

<p>In smaller market-towns the clergyman and deputies from the
peasants form this council.</p>

<p>When several villages join together to form one of these institutions,
a general committee is to be formed.</p>

<p>The members of the council for the institutions for the poor
are to be elected in the same way as the magistrates and mayors
(burgermeister).</p>

<p>When several parishes are joined together, a deputy is to be
chosen from each, and again, several are elected from among
these, who are to take immediate charge of the affairs. Each
deputy is chosen for three years, and is obliged to perform his
duties without remuneration; no inhabitant is allowed to refuse
to perform his functions the first time he is elected; extraordinary
merits in the service of the poor are to be publicly distinguished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mode of relief.</div>

<p>The public charge is brought into action in the following
manner:</p>

<p>1st. By institutions for working.</p>

<p>2d. By institutions for taking care of people who are unable
to work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>3d. By institutions for alms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Finding
work.</div>

<p>1. Materials and tools are to be distributed to those paupers
who, notwithstanding all inquiries and interference, cannot obtain
the necessary work, to be used at their houses until the required
situation can be obtained. If in larger towns the number
of these is very great, houses are to be opened and maintained at
the expense of the institution for the poor, in which the paupers
who are unoccupied are to work.</p>

<p>The choice among the different sorts of work in these houses
is settled according to the local circumstances, and chiefly according
to the facility with which either orders from private
persons can be received, or with which the material is obtained
and worked; then accordingly as the material can be used for
the wants of the poor or can be usefully employed for any other
purpose.</p>

<p>The houses for the employment of the poor are always to
retain their original destination, namely, an employment, for the
present, of poor men who would otherwise be without work, and
therefore do not admit any such persons whose names are not
down on the above-named register. Therefore those persons
are no longer allowed to work in this house after they have had
an offer of work from any other quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. In-door
relief.</div>

<p>2. Houses of nourishment are to be erected for those poor
who, besides having no fortune or means of obtaining their
livelihood, are in an extraordinary degree helpless, namely,
children, sick people, old persons, and cripples.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Money
relief.</div>

<p>3. Poor people who do not require extraordinary care, and
who are not fit to be admitted into the particular houses of
nourishment, or cannot yet be received into them, but are unable
to gain their livelihood, are to be assisted by alms, which, however,
are not to be given without the most complete proof of
want.</p>

<p>The alms are to be given in the form of gifts of money. These
gifts are sometimes to be increased, according to the price of
provisions; and from time to time a maximum is to be fixed,
which is on no account to be exceeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Relief by
quartering
on householders.</div>

<p>These gifts of money may, either in part or entirely, be substituted
by provisions, if this sort of aid is more easily afforded
with regard to lodging, nourishment, and clothing.</p>

<p>Their lodging is to be changed every day among the different
members of the parish, but the poor who are lodged are obliged
to repay this lodging by work. Where there are opportunities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
rooms are to be warmed, to which the poor may bring their work.</p>

<p>The nourishment of the poor can be facilitated and insured by
the equal division of them amongst the public, to be maintained
in turn, being obliged to partake of the work of their host, or by
voluntarily offered days for food, or lastly, by distribution of
bread and other nourishment. Where circumstances permit,
kitchens are to be erected on purpose for preparing nourishing
soups, partly gratis, partly very cheap.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liabilities
of pauper.</div>

<p>No pauper who partakes of the benefactions of the poor institutions
may go away from his dwelling without the knowledge
and leave of the head of the village, to stay for some time, or
permanently in another village, even if it is in the same district.</p>

<p>The same leave from the police direction is necessary when a
pauper wishes, for some good reason, to go out of his police
district; the leave is only to be given in both cases on well-grounded
reasons, and on proofs that the poor will not be burdensome
to other villages and districts; also he must give in a
declaration to the same, in which, besides his name and village,
and the duration of his absence, the villages to which he intends
to go must be expressed.</p>

<p>Paupers who have been warned in vain concerning bad conduct
and idleness shall be proceeded against without favour, by
the power of magistrates, and be punished accordingly.</p>

<p>The poor institutions can claim repayment from those hypocrites
who, although they possess private means, embezzle and
grasp at the gifts and assistance which are only intended for true
poverty, which shall be fully repaid. The poor institutions can
make the same claim from those persons who have renounced
their duty of supporting those relations whom they are obliged
to support, either by law or by contract.</p>

<p><i>No marriage between people without capital shall be allowed
without the previous permission of the poor institutions. Directors
who do not follow these orders, nor pay attention to the
Act of the 12th of July, 1808 (Government Paper, page 1506),
concerning marriages in the country, have to answer for the
maintenance of the new families, should they not be able to
maintain themselves. In the same manner, the priests and other
churchmen shall be responsible for the support of such persons
as they have married without leave from the authorities, besides
other fines which are imposed on this breach of the rules of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
marriage ceremony.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sources of
poor fund.</div>

<p>Besides the extraordinary sources, which consist partly in the
restitution which hypocrites and relations who avoid their duty
are obliged to make, and partly out of fines which are given to
the poor fund, or may be hereafter given, are sources for charity
from donations from the district fund, and from loans or from
taxes.</p>

<p>The yearly produce of all charities belongs to the poor institutions,
and is used for their purposes. With the establishments
for the poor are united the already existing or still accumulating
capitals of one or other of the poor institutions; the gain on
mortgages or on those possessions whose owners cannot be discovered;
the legacies for the poor, when by the will of the deceased
they are to be laid out in a regular yearly income, and
the fourth part of such legacies as are destined in general for
pious purposes.</p>

<p>The voluntary donations consist of casual gifts in money and
food which have been given by philanthropic persons of their
own accord, for the use of the poor institutions, and in this
manner are to be employed for their daily use. Besides these,
are the legacies which are meant for immediate division among
the poor, and those subscriptions which are collected either by
single persons or by companies and corporations.</p>

<p>General and extraordinary collections, in the name of the institutions
for the poor, are to be made monthly from house to
house, when the members of the parish have bound themselves to
a certain subscription; also in the churches on the great holidays,
and in the public-houses by means of private poor-boxes; and
lastly, on all important and joyful occasions of the state, or
companies.</p>

<p>According to the circumstances of the place, certain accidental
funds can be appropriated to the uses of the poor institutions,
which particularly on great joyful occasions, namely, great
marriages in the taverns, the permission to have music, particularly
past the stated times, processions of the apprentices,
shooting matches, &amp;c. &amp;c., at shows, balls, masquerades, and so on.</p>

<p>When all the aforesaid sources do not suffice to cover the
wants of the poor institutions, it will be supplied out of the funds
of the district, or through loans, and then only when all these
means cannot be put in practice, or do not suffice to cover their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
wants, compulsory contributions or poor-taxes are to be resorted
to. The manner and amount of these are to be according to the
calls of the villages and districts, and are only to be levied for a
certain time. It is to be observed, however, that these taxes are
to be imposed with the greatest equality, and without any exception
among all classes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Central
control.</div>

<p>The poor institutions and committees in such towns as have
no police directors or commissaries, also in the market towns
and parishes, are directly under the control of the district tribunal,
and under their guidance and inspection.</p>

<p>The inspection of the poor institutions of the whole kingdom
is given to the ministry for the interior, which is to receive regularly
the report of the state of this branch of administration from
the annual accounts and other proper sources, and which is to
issue the necessary general orders and regulations, and is to judge
of the proposals for the establishment, the arrangement and
fitting up of workhouses, and others in which the poor are taken
care of, for single districts, whole circles, or for the entire kingdom,
which decides with the ministry of finance all proposals for
allowing certain taxes and poor subscriptions, decides the complaints
brought against the general circle and local commissaries,
if such do not belong to the private council, and causes the election
of certain poor directors where it may be found advisable.</p>

</div>

<p>It will be observed, that these institutions bear a
considerable resemblance to those of Wurtemberg.
Their effects are thus summed up by Lord Erskine:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Upon carefully examining and considering these poor laws of
Bavaria. I have come to the conclusion in my own mind that
they are useful, and well adapted to the purposes for which they
were intended, because by the establishment of the poor institutions
(as they are called), by districts over the whole kingdom
of Bavaria, with sufficient power by law to carry their provisions
into execution, the great and important object is attained of
giving relief and support to the aged, helpless, and sick, and finding
work in workhouses or at their own homes, at a moderate payment,
for those who cannot otherwise obtain it; for which purpose
a register is to be kept by the guardians of the poor of all those
persons who are in want of work, and who are therefore either a
burthen upon the parish, or are likely to become so, as also a list<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of those who wish to employ workmen, in order to endeavour to
arrange between them the terms of employment; and that this
object may be the more easily attained, the directors are required
to be in continual communication with the overseers of public
works, the masters of manufactories, with individual proprietors,
and societies; in order that where there are a quantity of hands
capable of work, they may be passed into that part of the
country where they are most wanted; but whenever it may
happen that, notwithstanding all inquiries and exertions, the
necessary work cannot be obtained, in such cases materials and
tools are to be distributed to those paupers who may be in want
of them, to be used at their own houses; and if in larger towns
the number of those paupers should be very great, houses are to
be opened and maintained at the expense of the institutions for the
poor, in which the paupers who are out of work are to be employed;
but the number of paupers to be so employed is always
limited to those who have not had a reasonable offer of work
from any other quarter. But the great cause why the number
of the poor is kept so low in this country, arises from the prevention
by law of marriages in cases in which it cannot be proved
that the parties have reasonable means of subsistence; and this
regulation is in all places and at all times strictly adhered to.</p>

<p>The effect of a constant and firm observance of this rule has,
it is true, a considerable influence in keeping down the population
of Bavaria, which is at present low for the extent of country, but
it has a most salutary effect in averting extreme poverty and consequent
misery. (p. 554.)</p>

</div>

<p>The last of the countries subject to a system of
compulsory relief, from which we have a return, is
the ancient part of the</p>

<hr />

<h3>CANTON DE BERNE.</h3>

<p>It appears from that return, that the inhabitants
of that part of the Canton, which is subject to the
laws which we are going to describe, consisted, in
1831, of 321,468 persons, divided into three classes,
heimathloses, aubains, and bourgeois.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>The first class, which appears to be so small as
to be inconsiderable, consist of foreign refugees or
their descendants. The second comprises all those
who have not a right to bourgeoisie in any commune:
their number amounted, in 1780, to 3482
persons. It is said to have subsequently increased,
but it is not probable that it has more than doubled;
and we believe that 10,000 persons, or less than
1-32nd part of the whole population, exceeds the
whole number of those who are not entitled to
bourgeoisie; but it is to be observed that the word
“aubain,” though strictly meaning a person who
has no settlement in the Canton, is also applied to
persons who, though bourgeois, are not entitled to
bourgeoisie in the commune in which they reside.
The support of the heimathloses and of the aubains,
properly so called, that is, of those who have no
right whatever to bourgeoisie, falls on the government.</p>

<p>The third class is composed of the descendants
of those who, in the sixteenth century, were held
entitled to the public property of each commune,
and those who by themselves or their ancestors have
purchased bourgeoisie in any commune. Bourgeoisie
appears to be personal and hereditary. It
is not gained by residence, or lost by absence; and
may therefore, in fact, belong to persons having
little other connexion with the commune.</p>

<p>At a period, of which the precise date is not
stated, but which appears to belong to the seventeenth
century, it became the law that every one
was entitled to support from the commune of which
he was bourgeois, and that the sums necessary were
to be supplied from the public property of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
commune; and so far as that was insufficient, from
landed property, to whomsoever belonging, situated
in the commune, and from the personal property of
the bourgeois whether resident or not.</p>

<p>To this hereditary bourgeoisie the raising and
administration of the poor-fund was and still is
confided; and apparently with most unfortunate
results.</p>

<p>The following is the conclusion of the official
answer of the government of Berne to the questions
proposed by Mr. Morier (p. 207):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>What are the abuses complained of?</i></p>

<p><i>Do they arise from the principle of the law, or from the character
and social position of its administrators?</i></p>

<p><i>What remedies have been applied?</i></p>

<p><i>What have been their results?</i></p>

<p>The abuses in the administration arise both from the principle
of the law, and from the character and social position of its administrators:
from the law, because it abandons all administration
to the communes; from the administrators, because they neglect
improvement, distribute relief without discrimination or real
inquiry, and generally provide only against the exigences of the
moment.</p>

<p>The separate parishes, being, for the most part, too small to
establish schools and workhouses, want means of coercion, and are
in general more busied in providing relief for those actually indigent
than in diminishing their number, either as regards the present
or future generations. Besides, although the practice is not
sanctioned by law, many parishes, in order to prevent the return
of their bourgeois who are domiciled elsewhere, forward to them
relief without being able to ascertain their conduct.</p>

<p>The government has long felt that these abuses could not be
remedied except by a law founded on a principle totally different
from that of abandoning the administration to the parishes: but
from a mistaken solicitude for the poor, it always hesitated to
take this course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p><i>What has been the influence of the system?</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Statistically?</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Morally?</i></p>

<p>1. <i>Has the number of the indigent augmented, diminished, or
remained stationary?</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Does the law appear to have encouraged imprudent marriage
or illicit intercourse?</i></p>

<p>The answers are implied in our previous statements. The existing
system favours imprudent marriage and illicit intercourse,&mdash;but,
precisely because it encourages marriage, probably does not
augment the proportion of illegitimate to legitimate births. But
the final result is, that it encourages, in an extraordinary degree,
the increase of the indigent population. The abuses which have
followed this fatal system are too numerous to be here detailed.
It is easy to conceive what must have been its results on a populace
whom education, or rather the want of education, has deprived
of all honourable feeling, and of all preference of independence to
public charity. Idleness, carelessness, improvident marriage, and
illicit intercourse, have been encouraged by the prospect of making
others support their results. All means and opportunities of acquiring
knowledge, or skill, or regular occupation, have been
neglected. Thence have arisen not only a constantly increasing
burden upon society, but obstacles to the development of the physical
and intellectual faculties, to moral improvement, and in short
to the advancement of civilization. <i>Experience has clearly
proved, that the number of paupers increases in proportion to
the resources created for them, and that the bourgeois population
is least industrious and least active, and endeavours least to be
useful to society in those parishes which have the largest public
property and public revenue.</i></p>

<p>This state of things, and above all the constantly increasing
burden in some parts of the country, and the demands urged by
parishes on the State for protection against the claims and the insolence
of the really and the pretended indigent, have determined
the government to strive to remedy the evil at its source. We
are still ignorant of the proposed principles of the new law. The
plan, or at least the preparatory inquiry, is now going on in the
offices of the Department of the Interior. It is nearly certain,
however, that compulsory charity will be, if not entirely abolished,
at least restricted to those poor who are incapable of work. But
if assessment for the indigent is put an end to, the revenue of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
properties appropriated to them will remain for their support.</p>

<p>The administration of the poor-laws in the Canton of Berne is
therefore on the eve of a radical reform.</p>

</div>

<p>The same views are more fully developed in a
long and very able supplement to these answers,
which immediately follows them, and bears the same
official character&mdash;(pp. 220-222, and 225.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The administration of parochial property has not been properly
audited by any parochial authorities: frequently and for
many years it has remained in the hands of the same family;
those to whom it has been intrusted have received little or no
salary: a capricious and dishonest management were the obvious
and almost the inevitable consequences. The mere nature of the
transaction led to mal-administration. The poor who had a
right to bourgeoisie had a right to relief. How could their conduct
or their wants be ascertained, if they dwelt in other parishes,
with whose authorities their own parish had no relation? Was
it not almost inevitable that relief would be demanded with insolence
and spent in idleness and debauchery?</p>

<p>In some places in the mountains (such as Sieventhal and
Grindelwald), the relief was given in kind; but with the increased
circulation of money, money-relief has become general,
and is exclusively afforded to out-parishioners. The facility with
which such relief is mis-applied has favoured mis-management,
and may be said to engender pauperism.</p>

<p><i>These fatal results have become more strongly felt as the
number of the poor has augmented. In many places the growing
embarrassment occasioned great and praiseworthy remedial
efforts. The administration was made more regular, and
inspectors and other officers appointed. Some country parishes
erected alms-houses at an expense apparently beyond their
means. But many of these fine institutions disappointed the
hopes of their founders: we shall presently see why. These
new measures and institutions were each the private affair of
each parish; they failed because they were isolated. The
beneficial measures of one parish were not supported by its
neighbours. They followed their old routine, and opposed improvement
by obstacles and dislike. Superintendence, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
is essential to the administration of poor laws, was ineffectual,
because it was applied only to the parishioners of the single
commune which enforced it.</i></p>

<p>During the last half century, other countries have acquired
knowledge relative to alms-houses for the poor, and have adopted
the results of the inquiries and experience of their neighbours.
This has not been the case with our own establishments: their
very origin was erroneous. They were the products of a philanthropy
which proposed entirely to remedy all human misery.
They were founded in villages, and proportioned each to the
existing wants of the village. Their resources seldom permitted
the adoption of the first condition of good administration, namely,
classification. And even when we find a spacious building, we
see heaped, pell-mell, children by the side of the old and infirm,
and the sick mixed with able-bodied idlers. Even whole families
are found in this assemblage of the good and bad, the sick and
the healthy, the useful and the mischievous. In such establishments
provision ought to have been made for the education of the
children, the cure of the sick, the support of the aged, and the
employment of the able-bodied. Each class of inmates required
a separate treatment. The instant this principle is neglected,
and classification abandoned, the institution not only loses its
utility, but becomes actually mischievous. But each single
establishment was governed by a single authority, unfit for the
management of several dissimilar classes of inmates. In general,
one uniform system was applied to them all. A further obstacle
to the success of these establishments was the frequent change of
their governors. As they were ill-paid and often subject to disagreeable
contests with the local authorities, it was difficult to
get good officers, and still more so to keep them. (p. 221.)</p>

<p>Unfavourable as our representation of these establishments has
been, the picture of the treatment of the poor in the other parts
of the canton is still more gloomy and painful. In these districts
(superintendence being absent) all that is not left to accident is
regulated by habit, or by a routine without apparent motives.</p>

<p>In such places no regular system is to be looked for. The most
usual modes of affording relief are allowances in money, or payment
of board. In some places, as in Emmenthal, the parochial
charges are thrown on the large estates, and the proprietors are
forced in turn, and gratuitously, to maintain the paupers who are
allotted to them. In many other places it has long been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
custom to send round the poor to be maintained in turn by the
settled inhabitants (bourgeois), some of whom, though forced to
receive paupers, are themselves in indigent, or even in distressed
circumstances.</p>

<p>Not less sad or even revolting is the practice which prevails in
some poor and ill-judging parishes of getting rid of their poor by
allotting them to those who will take them on the lowest terms.
The parochial authorities offer an allowance to those who will
receive such and such paupers. The allowance at first proposed
is very small; but it is ready money, and public competition
enables the parish to make it still smaller. The poor victim falls
into the hands of a rapacious and needy family. We may conceive
how deplorable his situation must always be. That it is
sometimes supportable can be attributed only to a benevolence
not yet entirely stifled in the hearts of our people. Cases even
have occurred in which the proprietors, by allowing their inmates
to work for themselves, have given them habits of industry, and
bred up their children to be good workmen. But these exceptions
only render the general rule more apparent.</p>

<p>Relief in money produces effects equally pernicious. It is the
result of the law which enables every family which is, or believes
itself to be, in want, to demand a relief which cannot be refused.
Small sums are given sometimes for payment of rent, sometimes
to meet other wants, whether the applicant live in the parish or
elsewhere&mdash;and without control or superintendence. What can,
what must be the consequences? (p. 222.)</p>

<p>We cannot wonder, then, that the administration of the poor
laws in the canton of Berne has become so irregular and so mischievous.
The effects of the subdivision of the inhabitants into
so many corporations have become more and more apparent.
The principle of permanent and hereditary unions necessarily
clashed with the principle of mobility and change which governs
all our social relations. The welfare of the public necessarily
gave way to that of the particular corporations, and the private
interests of the corporations or parishes rendered them selfish and
mutually hostile. <i>Obstacles were opposed to every change of
residence, and consequently the industry and enterprise of the
labouring classes were paralyzed, and the parishes felt the results
of their own measures when an unemployed and dispirited population
was thrown upon them. It was to be expected that in
time this population would look for support to the relief to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
they had a legal right; it was natural that in time they would
get a taste for an idle and consequently vicious existence.</i> We
could support our remarks by many instances of whole families
which have subsisted like parasites from year to year, and from
generation to generation, on the parochial funds; whose status it
is to be paupers; and the cases in which they have emerged from
this condition are few.</p>

</div>

<p>The government appears to have been struggling
with these evils ever since the beginning of this
century. The first ordonnance which has been forwarded
to us is that of the 22d December, 1807.</p>

<p>The following are its most material enactments
(pp. 191, 192):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The parishes and parochial corporations (bourgeoisies) in the
town and in the country are required, as heretofore, to afford protection
and relief to their needy fellow-citizens.</p>

<p>No one can claim parochial relief unless he is without property,
and either physically incapable of work, or out of employ
without his own fault.</p>

<p>Parishes may continue their previous modes of regulating and
fixing their accounts with respect to the poor.</p>

<p>They may likewise relieve their poor as they think fit, by regular
money relief, by putting them out to board, by collecting them
in a single establishment, or placing them in hospitals, or distributing
among themselves the children of the indigent. But it is
forbidden for the future that, except in cases of emergency, and
with the sanction of the district authorities, they should be sent
round from house to house to be maintained. Persons arrested for
begging, and taken to their parish, shall be sentenced by the
parochial authorities, after having given notice to the district
judge. The punishment may be eight days’ imprisonment on
bread and water, or fifteen days’ hard labour<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>.</p>

<p><i>An equally rigorous treatment is to be applied to those who,
being in the receipt of parochial relief, are disobedient, or give
rise to well-founded complaint. They may be forbidden to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
inns, or drinking-shops, and punished in the above-mentioned
manner if they disobey.</i></p>

<p>Parishes may require their overseers to watch the conduct of
those who, from extravagance, drunkenness, debauchery, or
other misbehaviour, are in danger of poverty, and to proceed
legally to have them placed under restrictions. Such persons
may be forbidden by the prefect, on the application of the parish,
to frequent, for a certain period, inns and drinking-shops.</p>

<p>If a person who has received relief subsequently obtains any
property, his parish may demand to be reimbursed their expenditure
on his behalf, but without interest; and though they may
not have exercised their right during his life, they may proceed
against his estate after his death.</p>

<p><i>No pauper can marry without the consent of his parish, nor
without having reimbursed it for the relief which he has
received.</i> The same law applies to widowers, who, while married,
had received relief for themselves or their children. None
who are relieved in consequence of sickness or infirmity should
be allowed to marry, except in extreme cases.</p>

<p>No minister, unless with the permission of the parish, ought to
announce from the pulpit the intended marriage of one whom he
knows to be in the receipt of relief.</p>

<p>If children, in consequence of the idleness, debauchery, gambling,
or voluntary desertion of their father, become chargeable to
the parish, and it is alleged that the father if he had been industrious
and frugal could have supported them, the overseers
may bring an action against him for the amount of the relief
which has been afforded to his children; and if he do not pay he
may be suspended from the exercise of all civil rights and claims
as a bourgeois, <i>or be sentenced to not exceeding two years’ imprisonment
in a house of correction</i>. A second offence is to be
more severely punished.</p>

<p>A mother wilfully abandoning her children shall be taken back
to her parish and there kept to work. If she refuse, or attempt
to escape, she may, on the requisition of her parish, and subject
to an appeal to the Council of State, be sentenced to not exceeding
three years’ imprisonment in a house of correction.</p>

<p>Women who have had several bastards chargeable to the
parish may, on the requisition of their parishes, be similarly
punished.
No one receiving, or who has received, parochial assistance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
either on his own account or on that of his children can, unless
specially authorized so to do by his parish, be present at parochial
meetings, until he has repaid all the sums advanced to him.</p>

<p>If any person entitled to parochial relief shall be refused, or
insufficiently relieved, he may complain to the Prefect, who shall
thereupon hear the allegations of the parish, and ascertain the
condition of the complainant, with the assistance, if he has any
doubt as to the existence or degree of his bodily infirmities, of a
physician. The Prefect may then order such relief as may
appear to him necessary, but no part of it is to be given in
money.</p>

</div>

<p>It appears, however, to have been unsuccessful;
for 12 years after, the government, after having in
vain offered rewards for good advice on the subject
(p. 225), by an ordonnance dated the 14th April,
1819, absolutely forbade the levying of rates
higher than the average of those of the years 1813,
1814, and 1815. The failure of so coarse a remedy
might have been predicted, and accordingly
we find the present state of the country thus described
in the official report (p. 214):&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>It is evident that, with respect to pauperism, the present situation
of the Canton de Berne is in the highest degree painful.
The evil is not temporary or partial: it arises from no external
or accidental sources: a considerable portion of the population is
attacked by it, and it is spreading itself, like a moral blight, over
the whole community.</p>

<p>Some districts, or some classes, may perhaps suffer less than
others, but the malady continues its progress and its extension:
if it decrease in one place, it grows in another. It is indeed
evident that it contains within itself the elements of its own
increase. Not merely the annual augmentation of the number
of paupers, but their constantly increasing misconduct, their
carelessness, and insolence, and above all, their utter immorality,
prove the augmenting force of the evil; an evil which must
destroy all benevolent feelings, and swallow up, without being
satisfied, all that charity can supply.
The contagious nature of the disease carries it beyond the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
indigent, to invade and destroy the classes immediately above
them. Those whose daily labour ought to have supported them,
and those small proprietors whose properties ought to have
enabled them to maintain their families, satisfy their engagements,
and contribute to the relief of the poor, even these classes
throw themselves among the really indigent, and add weight to
the load which oppresses those who cannot escape the poor tax.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It is not easy to say what is meant by the original; whether labour in
irons, “enchainement au bloc,” is a necessary part of the punishment or not.</p>
</div>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>Causes favourable to the working of the above institutions.</h2>

<p>We have now given a very brief outline of the
institutions of those portions of the Continent
which appear, from the returns, to have adopted
the English principle of acknowledging in every
person a right to be supported by the public. It
will be observed that in no country, except, perhaps,
the Canton de Berne, has compulsory relief
produced evils resembling, either in intensity or in
extent, those which we have experienced; and that
in the majority of the nations which have adopted
it, the existing system appears to work well.</p>

<p>These opposite consequences from the adoption
of the same principle, may be accounted for on several
different grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1. Villenage.</div>

<p>1. Among some of the nations in question villenage
still exists. Now where slavery, in any of
its forms, prevails, the right of the slave or villein
to support is a necessary and a safe consequence.
It is necessary, because a person who is not a free
agent cannot provide for himself. It is safe, because
one of the principal evils of pauperism, improvidence,
can scarcely exist among slaves, and
the power of the master enables him to prevent
idleness and fraud. The poor laws of Russia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
therefore, if they can be called poor laws, are
merely parts of her system of slavery.</p>

<div class="sidenote">2. Recency
of the
system.</div>

<p>2. Among most of the other nations in question
the compulsory system is in its infancy. Denmark
has only lately got rid of slavery, and her poor
laws date from 1798. Those of Sweden, in their
present form, of Mecklenburg, Saxony, Wurtemberg
and Bavaria, all bear the appearance of recency.
In Wurtemberg assessments had been long
obsolete, until they were re-introduced during the
famine of 1817. The only country in which the
compulsory system appears to have continued as
long as it has in England, is that in which it has
produced effects resembling those which have followed
it with us, namely, the Canton de Berne.</p>

<div class="sidenote">3. Small
number of
persons
wholly dependent
on
wages.</div>

<p>3. Another circumstance which renders compulsory
relief less dangerous in the countries which
we have been considering than in our own, is the
economical situation of their labouring population.
In England the great mass of the people are day-labourers,
enjoying, where they have escaped the
oppression of poor law abuses, high wages and
steady employment, but possessed of little visible
property, and seldom living under their masters’
roof. Such persons are not deterred from demanding
relief by the fear of losing their property, since,
where they have any, it is capable of concealment;
and they need not always even fear degradation,
since the fact of their receiving it may often be
concealed. There are many instances in the Poor
Law Evidence in which the masters, and even the
companions of paupers, were not aware of their receiving
allowance. But the class of persons without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
visible property, which constitutes the bulk of
English society, forms the small minority of that of
the north of Europe. The Norwegian return states,
(698 and 699) that at the last census in 1825, out
of a population of 1,051,318 persons, there were
59,464 freeholders. As by 59,464 freeholders
must be meant 59,464 heads of families, or about
300,000 individuals, the freeholders must form
more than a fourth of the whole population. Mr.
Macgregor states (p. 300) that in Denmark (by
which Zealand and the adjoining islands are probably
meant), out of a population of 926,110, the
number of landed proprietors and farmers is
415,110, or nearly one-half. In Sleswick Holstein,
out of a population of 604,085, it is 196,017,
or about one-third. The proportion of proprietors
and farmers to the whole population is not given
in Sweden; but the Stockholm return estimates
the average quantity of land annexed to a labourer’s
habitation at from one to five acres
(p. 375); and though the Gottenburg return gives
a lower estimate, it adds, that the peasants possess
much of the land. (p. 387.) In Wurtemberg
we are told that more than two-thirds of the labouring
population are the proprietors of their own
habitations, and that almost all own at least a
garden of from three-quarters of an acre to an acre
and a half. (p. 511.)</p>

<p>All the returns concur in stating the number of
day-labourers to be very small.</p>

<p>The Norwegian report states, that “by law servants
should never be hired for a shorter period
than a twelvemonth. Employing labourers by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
day, though often done in and about towns, is
consequently illegal.” (p. 695.) Few day-labourers
are to be met with. (p. 698.) The Gottenburgh,
that “strictly speaking there are in Sweden
few labourers on the same footing as in England.”
(p. 387.) The Russian, that “the labourers are almost
all slaves,” and that “the average quantity of
land allowed by a proprietor to his slave is 15
acres.” (p. 334.) The Danish report, that “the
day-labourers form in Zealand and the adjoining
islands less than one-fifth, and in Sleswick Holstein
less than one-third of the agricultural population.”
(p. 300.) The Wurtemberg report states
the labourers to amount to 41,913 (meaning of
course heads of families, or about 210,000 individuals)
out of a population of 1,518,147, being in
fact less than 1-7th. (p. 514.) The Bavarian, that
“in the country there are very few day-labourers,
as almost every person has some ground of his own,
and few are rich enough to hire labour.” (p. 556.)</p>

<p>It is probable therefore that the class of persons
who in the north of Europe and Germany would
be exposed to the temptation of applying for public
relief if it were granted on the same terms as in
England, would be a small minority instead of a
large majority, and would be perhaps a seventh,
fifth, or at most a third instead of three-fourths,
or even a larger proportion of the whole community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">4. The situation
of the
pauper
being made
less eligible
than that
of the independent
labourer.</div>

<p>4. But the conditions on which parochial assistance
is afforded in the countries in question, form
perhaps the principal difference between their systems
and that which we have adopted. In England,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
where the scale and the allowance system
prevail, no condition whatever can be said to be
imposed on the pauper. What he receives is a mere
gratuitous addition to his income. Even where
work is required, the hours are in general fewer,
and the labour less severe than those of the independent
labourer. And the workhouse, the most
powerful of our instruments of repression, affords,
in general, food, lodging, clothing and warmth,
better than can be found in the cottage, <i>and may
be quitted at a day’s notice</i>.</p>

<p>But in all the countries which we have been considering,
except the Canton de Berne and perhaps
Denmark, the great object of pauper legislation,
that of rendering the situation of the pauper less
agreeable than that of the independent labourer,
has been effectually attained.</p>

<p>On recurring to the statements which we have
extracted, it will be seen that he loses all right to
property; that he becomes incapable of contracting
marriage while receiving relief, and in many countries,
if he have once received relief, cannot marry
until he has reimbursed the parish, or has procured
security that his future family shall not become
chargeable, or till three years have elapsed since
he last received relief. If married, he loses control
over his children, he cannot choose his residence or
his occupation, and if he once becomes the inmate
of a workhouse <i>he incurs the risk of imprisonment for
life</i>. When such are the terms offered by the public,
it is easy to understand that none but the really
destitute will accept them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">5. Restraints
imposed
on
the labouring
classes.</div>

<p>5. The prevalence of habits productive of pauperism
is repressed by subjecting the whole labouring
population to superintendence and restrictions,
which we should consider vexatious. As they are
in a great measure interwoven with the laws for the
relief of the unemployed, and have been in general
already stated, it is not necessary to repeat them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">6. Prevention
of improvident
marriage.</div>

<p>6. In almost all the countries which have been
mentioned, endeavours are made to prevent the existence
of a redundant population, by throwing obstacles
in the way of improvident marriage. Marriage
on the part of persons in the actual receipt of
relief, appears to be everywhere prohibited, and
the marriage of those who are not likely to possess
the means of independent support, is allowed by
very few.</p>

<p>Thus we are told that in Norway no one can
marry without “showing, to the satisfaction of the
clergyman, that he is permanently settled in such
a manner as to offer a fair prospect that he can
maintain a family.” (p. 697.)</p>

<p>In Mecklenburg, that “marriages are delayed
by conscription in the 22d year, and military service
for six years; besides, the parties must have a
dwelling, without which a clergyman is not permitted
to marry them. The men marry at from 25
to 30, the women not much earlier, as both must
first gain by service enough to establish themselves.”
(p. 423.)</p>

<p>In Saxony, “that a man may not marry before
he is 21 years old, if liable to serve in the army.”
In Dresden, “professionists, (by which word artizans
are probably meant,) may not marry until they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
become masters in their trade.” (p. 482.)</p>

<p>In Wurtemberg, “that no man is allowed to marry
till his 25th year, on account of his military duties,
unless permission be especially obtained or purchased:
at that age he must also obtain permission,
which is granted on proving that he and his wife
would have together sufficient to maintain a family,
or to establish themselves; in large towns, say
from 800 to 1000 florins, (from 66<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to
84<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>;) in smaller, from 400 to 500 florins;
in villages, 200 florins, (16<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>) They must
not be persons of disorderly or dissolute lives,
drunkards, or under suspicion of crime, and they
must not have received any assistance from their
parish within the last three years.” (p. 511.)</p>

<p>And we have seen that a similar law prevails
and is strictly enforced in Bavaria.</p>

<div class="sidenote">7. Provision
for the
education
of the
labouring
classes.</div>

<p>7. Another means by which the extension of pauperism
is opposed in the countries which we have
described, is the care taken by the government to
provide for the education of the labouring classes.
We are told (pp. 695 and 698) that in Norway
their children have free access to the parish schools,
and that the poor pay for the education of their
children, and for religious teachers, nothing or
nearly so. The general report from Russia states
(p. 332) that every parish in every town has a
school which is open to children of all classes,
under the direction of the clergyman; and this is
borne out by the consular return from Archangel.
(p. 337.) The Gottenburg report states (p. 385)
that in Sweden gratuitous education is provided for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
children of the indigent, and that it is asserted
that there is not one person out of 1000 who cannot
at least read. The Danish reports state (pp.
264, 293) that the children of all poor persons are
educated gratuitously: that the parish is taxed for
the payment of the schoolmaster, the repairs of the
schoolhouse, books, papers, pens, ink, &amp;c.; and
that parents are bound under a penalty to send
their children regularly to school until they have
passed the age of 14, and been confirmed. Gratuitous
education is also afforded in Mecklenburg
(p. 491) and in Prussia. Mr. Gibsone states, as
the general law of the country, that “all children
capable of going to school are obliged to attend it.
Those whose parents are unable to pay the expense,
must be sent thither at the cost of the community
to which they belong” (p. 460); “the expense
of school-money and religious instruction is about
1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> yearly for each child.” (p. 466.) In the detailed
regulation for the relief of the poor in Berlin,
(p. 455,) it is laid down that “the period of children
being sent to school regularly commences at
the beginning of the child’s seventh year, and terminates
when the child, according to the testimony
of the minister, has acquired the knowledge necessary
for his station in life, which generally occurs
on his attaining his 14th year. If parents allow
their children to grow up without instruction, the
commissioners for the relief of the poor are to
remonstrate with them, and should this be of no
avail, the commissary of police is to interfere.” In
Saxony, “the local poor commission supports free
schools.” (p. 480.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>The care which has been bestowed on this subject
in Wurtemberg is remarkable. The government
report, after stating the recent introduction
and success of infant schools, adds that&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>For older children, from the age of 6 to 14, there has long
existed in Wurtemberg in every, even the smallest community,
supported chiefly at the expense of the local church estate and
community fund, and of the parents, with the co-operation, however,
of the public treasury, a <i>German or elementary school</i>,
which all children of that age, both boys and girls, must attend,
and in which, with the exception of short holidays during the
time of haymaking, harvest and vintage, they receive throughout
the year every day, with the exception of Sundays and holidays,
in winter for five and in summer for at least two hours, instruction
in religion, morality, singing, the German language, reading,
writing, arithmetic, and the elements of natural philosophy,
natural history, geography and history. In summer, in consideration
of the work in the fields, the instruction is given as much
as possible in the morning; and at the season when the labours
of the field are the most urgent, and in cases of great poverty,
an exception is made in favour of those children, where it is
required, who, on application, are excused two or three times a
week from coming to school. With this exception, every illegal
neglect of school is punished by a fine of two or three kreutzers,
and if the neglect of attending is continued, from four to six
kreutzers; and no child, even if it has completed the 14th year,
is suffered to leave the elementary school till it has acquired sufficient
knowledge of what is taught there. (p. 528.)</p>

<p>As, however, many poor children endeavour notwithstanding
to avoid attending the elementary schools, and in all cases the
instruction in these elementary schools occupies only the smaller
portion of the day, so that those poor children who are not properly
attended and employed by their parents have still plenty of
time for idleness and beggary; attempts have latterly been made
in some places to put such children under special superintendence,
as, for instance, by appointing a guardian for each poor
child in the person of an overseer or other public officer of the
community, or of a neighbour, who has to observe it every
where, at home, at work, at play; or by periodical general summons
to the several parents; or by periodical visitations in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
houses of poor families, especially of those who are suspected of
not paying proper attention to the education of their children;
or by the periodical exhibition of the work done at home; or by
the public performance of some work as a specimen; or by gratuitously
providing the poor children with tools and materials;
by the distribution of rewards among the most diligent and skilful
of the children; and by exhorting, summoning, and punishing
negligent parents; by these means to acquire the certainty that
such children are kept to the constant attendance of the church
and school, and to doing their tasks; that they are sufficiently
employed in a suitable manner; that they are not ill-treated,
either by being overworked or by unmerited corporal chastisement;
that they are not neglected with respect to clothing and
cleanliness; and that they are not abandoned to idleness, beggary
and other vices, &amp;c. (p. 529.)</p>

<p>Partly to retain, by practice, what they have learnt in the elementary
schools, and partly to promote the further improvement
of the grown-up youth, a <i>Sunday School</i> is kept in every community
in Wurtemberg, in the common school-room, where every
youth and girl above 14 years of age, in the Protestant places to
their 18th, and in Catholic places to their 21st year, must go every
Sunday, or where there is only one school-room the youths and
girls every Sunday alternately, and attend the lessons for at least an
hour and a half, on pain of paying four kreutzers, and if the neglect
is of long continuance, six kreutzers, for every time that they remain
away. It may be added, that, according to the existing laws,
more care has lately been taken that young persons of this age,
unless they are wanted to assist their parents in their domestic and
field-work, particularly those who are educated at the public
expense, and the poor girls and youths discharged from the penal
establishments, <i>do not remain at home with their families</i>, or,
out of love to a more unrestrained way of life, endeavour to
gain a livelihood as <i>Eigenbrödler</i><a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>, as they are called, merely by
sewing, knitting, &amp;c., but that they try either to engage as
servants or learn a trade. (p. 534.)</p>

</div>

<p>The Bavarian poor law enacts, that all the children
of the poor shall, without favour and without
regard to the usual pretexts, be kept to the practice
of the public school and religious instructions, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
also of frequenting the work and industry schools,
and of learning a trade. The school money is to be
paid from the poor institutions. (p. 559.)</p>

<p>Among all the Continental communities which
recognize in the poor the right to relief, the only
one which does not appear to provide the means of
education, and to enforce their being made use of,
is that in which pauperism has become absolutely
intolerable, namely, the Canton de Berne; and
even there any aubain (or person not entitled to
bourgeoisie in the parish in which he resides) may
be summarily ejected (unless possessed of landed
property in it), if it can be proved that he does not
either send his children to school or provide otherwise
for their education. (p. 199.)</p>

<div class="sidenote">8. Central
superintendence.</div>

<p>8. Lastly, in most of the countries which have
been considered, the local administration of the
laws for the relief of the poor is controlled by a
central superintending authority.</p>

<p>The only countries, the reports from which state
that this is not the case, are Sweden, Denmark,
and Berne; and we have seen both that these are
the three countries in which the poor laws are the
worst administered, and that in all of them the mal-administration
which the reporters deplore is mainly
attributed by them to the absence of a central
control.</p>

<hr />

<p>We now proceed to give a short outline of the
institutions for the relief of the poor in those countries
which do not appear, from the reports in this
Appendix, to acknowledge a legal right in the
applicant.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<h3>HANSEATIC TOWNS.</h3>

<h4><i>Hamburgh.</i></h4>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">Hamburgh.</span>&mdash;The situation of Hamburgh, a
large commercial town, with a small territory and
few manufactures, exposes it to a considerable
influx of foreign poor; and the number of charitable
establishments appears to have fostered and
still to encourage pauperism to an extent exceeding
the average of the north of Europe. It appears
from the Consul-general’s return, that besides many
endowed schools, hospitals, and almshouses, the
city possesses a general institution for the poor,
supported by the interest of its own capital and by
some voluntary contributions, and considerable
advances from the treasury of the State. A report
has been furnished of the proceedings of that institution
during the year 1832.</p>

<p>It appears by that report (pp. 397, 398) that in
1832, 141,858 current dollars, or about 25,000<i>l.</i>
sterling, was distributed in money, by way of
weekly relief among registered or regular poor,
amounting at an average to 2,900 individuals, or
heads of families; the smallest weekly relief being
8 schillings or 7<i>d.</i> sterling; the largest for an individual,
2 dollars or 7<i>s.</i> sterling; and for family,
3 dollars or 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Half of the adult paupers
appear to have been foreigners. Besides the
amount of money relief, considerable sums were
expended in the distribution of soup, clothing, beds
and bed clothing, and fuel, and in the education
and maintenance of poor children, and in medical
relief to the sick. Both the Consul’s report and
that of the institution, lament the absence of a
workhouse. “Of those who are capable, but will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
not work,” says the latter, “a great number to be
sure will be found: the only help against this
would perhaps be an institution, under a strict
superintendence of the police, for compelling them
to work; the want of which, from the undeniably
increasing degeneration of our lowest class of people,
is sensibly felt from year to year.” (p. 402.)
This statement is borne out by the progressive
increase of the registered paupers, from 2,332 in
May 1826 to 2,969 in May 1832, and by the large
amount of the regular out-door relief in money,
amounting, on a population of 130,000, to very
nearly 4<i>s.</i> a head. Further evidence of the extent
of pauperism is afforded by the number of persons
buried in 1832 at the expense of the institution,
which was 459, or nearly one-tenth of the average
number of deaths.</p>

<p>No means exist of forcing parents to educate
their children; a defect deplored by the institution.
(p. 403.)</p>

<h4><i>Bremen.</i></h4>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Bremen.</span>&mdash;The poor institutions of Bremen
seem to resemble those of Hamburgh; but the general
enforcement of education, the use of a workhouse,
and perhaps other circumstances not mentioned
in the report, appear to have rendered their
results more beneficial. The following answers to
questions 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of the Commissioners’
questions, give a short outline of the existing
system:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>3. To what extent and under what regulations are there district
houses of industry for receiving the destitute able-bodied, or any
part of their families, and supplying them with food, clothes, &amp;c.,
and in which they are set to work?&mdash;There exists but one poor-house
in Bremen, in which the destitute able-bodied are received,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to the number of 220, lodged, fed, and clothed, for which they
are bound to work, for the benefit of the institution, as far as
they are able.</p>

<p>4. To what extent and under what regulations do any religious
institutions give assistance to the destitute, by receiving them
as inmates, or by giving them alms?&mdash;Independently of three
houses for the lodging and partly providing for poor widows,
free of expense, there are other buildings set apart for the reception
of poor superannuated or helpless women; but chiefly a number
of private institutions for the relief of poor deserving persons
by testamentary bequests. Such are the Rheden, the Tiedemann,
the Nonnen, the Von Bühren, &amp;c., so called.</p>

<p>5. To what extent and under what regulations is work provided
at their own dwellings for those who have trades, but do
not procure work for themselves?&mdash;This is done, but in a very
limited degree, at the public expense, as those who have trades
come under the care and superintendence of their respective
guilds, whose duty and credit it is to prevent any of their fraternity
coming upon the parish, and who can easily afford the
means of providing them with work. Females, on application to
the poor-house, may receive hemp and flax for spinning, and are
remunerated accordingly.</p>

<p>7. To what extent and under what regulations are fuel, clothing,
or money distributed to such persons or their families; at
all times of the year, or during any particular seasons?&mdash;Those
who are registered in the poor-house list, and thus come under
the superintendence and control of the parish officers, receive, as
long as they may require assistance,&mdash;1. A small monthly allowance
in money. 2. Clothing for themselves and their families.
3. If necessary, bedding. 4. In the winter, during severe frost,
fuel.</p>

<p>8. To what extent and under what regulations are they relieved
by their children being taken into schools, and fed, clothed, and
educated or apprenticed?&mdash;Means are not only afforded to the
poor for sending their children to school and for giving them
religious instruction, but they are here compelled to do so, on
pain of forfeiting all claim to parochial relief, or by other modes
of punishment. <i>That every child in the State, of whatever
descent, shalt be subjected to school discipline and tuition</i>, is
founded upon the principle, that no means so effectually obviates
that general poverty, among the lower classes in particular, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
an attention to the development of their minds, by which they
acquire that self-confidence that stimulates exertion, and that
proper spirit of independence that keeps them above want, whilst
by religious instruction they are impressed with a sense of the
duties and advantages of good moral conduct through life. It
has ever been the prevailing opinion in this Republic, that the
principal duty of the State towards bettering the condition of
its poorer classes, rests upon a due regard to this school discipline,
and that it tends in its practice to prevent the frequent
recurrence of application for relief in the same family; the
descendants of which, without such control, would habitually
and irrecoverably become, in their turn, dependents upon public
charity. When such children have arrived at the age of 14 or
15 years, after having been taught reading, writing, arithmetic,
and any other acquirement consistent with their situation, books,
and other materials being furnished them by the poor-house,
gratis; they are, after confirmation, generally put out to service,
and thus prevented from returning to the idle habits of their
parents. Girls are, in like manner, often provided for. They
are taught reading, writing, knitting, and needle-work. (pp.
410, 411.)</p>

</div>

<h4><i>Lubeck.</i></h4>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Lubeck.</span>&mdash;If the statistical returns respecting
Lubeck, which however do not appear to rest on
enumeration, can be depended on, the proportion of
deaths, births, and marriages to the whole population
is less than in any other part of Europe. The deaths
being stated to be 1 in 56; the births 1 in 53½;
and the marriages 1 in 177. And, what is perhaps
the strongest indication of the general welfare
of a community, the deaths under the age of one
year are stated to be only 1 in 7. The following
answers to questions 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8, may be
compared with the corresponding answers from
Bremen:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>3. To what extent and under what regulations are there district
houses of industry for receiving the destitute able-bodied, or any
part of their families, and supplying them with food, clothes, &amp;c.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
and in which they are set to work?&mdash;No other institution of this
kind exists here but the work and poor-house, called the Cloister,
into which, however, none are admitted but persons totally incapable
of contributing to their own support, whether from
drunkenness or other incapacitating causes.</p>

<p>4. To what extent and under what regulations do any religious
institutions give assistance to the destitute, by receiving them as
inmates, or by giving them alms?&mdash;We have none such, but a
collection is made in all our churches every Sunday for the poor;
this, however, being a regular matter-of-course thing, yields comparatively
small sums, which are privately distributed to poor persons
by the churchwardens and deacons.</p>

<p>5. To what extent and under what regulations is work provided
at their own dwellings for those who have trades, but do
procure work for themselves?&mdash;or for such persons in agriculture
or on public works? Every able-bodied man is supposed
capable of providing for himself, and no such work or relief is
afforded him. In winter, many poor women are supplied with a
little work by the overseers of the workhouse, who give them flax
to spin. The average annual quantity thus spun is about 6000
to 6500 pounds, the pay for which, amounting to about 130<i>l.</i>
annually, relieves about 300 poor women. The linen yarn thus
spun is disposed of by lottery among the wealthier classes. No
work is supplied at the public expense or by public institutions
to able-bodied men, merely because they are destitute; they must
seek and find it themselves, and are of course accepted and employed
on public works, as far as there is a demand for them.
Having no relief to expect elsewhere, they are of course spurred
on to exertion, and if sober and of good character, it may be
generally assumed that they find work, at least sufficient for their
bare existence, since, if a man can earn but a few pence daily, it
will suffice to support him in this country.</p>

<p>7. To what extent and under what regulations are fuel, clothing,
or money, distributed to such persons or their families; at all
times of the year, or during any particular seasons?&mdash;As above
stated, no relief of this kind is afforded to able-bodied men; their
families, if considered destitute, may perhaps obtain the relief
afforded by the poor-board to the poor generally, by means of
portions of cheap food daily during the five winter months, and
four times a week during the other part of the year. About
230,000 such portions are distributed annually, and bread to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
value of about 60<i>l.</i> Fuel is distributed during the severer part of
the winter, but money is rarely given, and only in extreme cases,
never exceeding one mark, or about 14<i>d.</i> sterling a week, to the
same party. Clothing forms no part of the relief afforded. In
Lubeck these various kinds of relief are partaken of by about 850
persons annually.</p>

<p>8. To what extent, and under what regulations, are they relieved
by their children being taken into schools, and fed, clothed, and
educated, or apprenticed?&mdash;Not only are all the children of the
poor admitted into the poor-schools for instruction gratis, but
when relief is afforded by the poor-board, it is on the positive
condition that they shall send their children to such schools.
Neither food, clothing, nor any further provision is afforded them,
in these schools, excepting in a very few extreme cases, in which
the maintenance of very young children is undertaken by the poor-board.
The number of children in our poor-schools averages
about 300. (p. 415, 416.)</p>

<p>The allowance in our poor and workhouse for every individual,
is&mdash;</p>

<p>Marriages among the poor are delayed by the necessity a man
is under, <i>first</i>, of previously proving that he is in a regular employ,
work, or profession, that will enable him to maintain a wife; and
<i>secondly</i>, of becoming a burgher, and equipping himself in the
uniform of the burgher guard, which, together, may cost him
nearly 4<i>l.</i> (p. 419.)</p>

<p>The condition of the labouring classes living on their own
earnings is considered by themselves to be far superior to that of
the paupers maintained in our poor-house. The partial assistance
afforded by the poor-board is chiefly directed towards aiding those
who are not devoid of honest pride, and have some feelings of
independence left, who consequently earn their own maintenance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
as far as they can, and are thus assisted in their endeavours to
support themselves, and keep out of the workhouse. The aid
they receive is proportioned to their age and families, and is
mostly granted to females; it is gratefully received, and no idea
exists of ever thinking it a right. As a rule, no persons fully able
to work can receive assistance; they are therefore forced to seek
out employment, and may be generally presumed to succeed. If
they get but a moderate portion of work, very trifling earnings
place them in a situation much more eligible than that of the
pauper maintained in the poor-house. (p. 418.)</p>

<h3>FRANKFORT ON THE MAIN.</h3>

<p>The institutions for the relief of the poor in Frankfort
do not appear to require much notice.</p>

<p>The most striking circumstance mentioned in the
report is, that the orphans and deserted children
brought up in the public establishments are so
carefully and successfully educated, that on an
average they turn out better than those merely
kept to school and living at home. (p. 567.) Permission
to marry is not granted to a person who
cannot prove his ability to support a family.</p>

<h3>HOLLAND.</h3>

<p>As the Canton de Berne appears to be the portion
of continental Europe in which the burthen of
legal relief is most oppressive, Holland appears to
be that in which pauperism, unaided by a legal
claim, is the most rapidly advancing. The Appendix
contains an official communication from the
Dutch government, and answers from His Majesty’s
Consul in Amsterdam, to the Commissioners’ questions.</p>

<p>The clearest general view of the mode in which
relief is administered, is contained in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
extract from the Consul’s report: (p. 581.)</p>

<div class="blockquote"><div class="sidenote">General
view of the
Dutch
system.</div>

<p>The main support of the poor is derived from religious communities
and charitable institutions. Every denomination of
Christians, as well as the Jews, relieve their own members;
and for this purpose have, for the most part, orphan and
poor-houses, and schools connected with them, which are supported
by property belonging to them, and by voluntary contributions
at the church-doors, and collections at the houses of the
members: the Jews being permitted occasionally to make a general
collection throughout the city for their own purposes. These
establishments, among the Protestants (the most numerous community),
are called Deaconries; and they provide not only for the
support of their indigent members, but also for their relief in sickness.
The deacons, who have the immediate superintendence of
the poor, limit the assistance given according to the exigency of
the case, which they investigate very narrowly; and by becoming
particularly acquainted with the situation of the applicants, are
enabled to detect any imposition. The pecuniary relief afforded
is very small, and can only be considered as in aid of the exertions
of the poor to earn their own support, being limited to a
few pence in the week; a weekly donation of 2 florins (or 40<i>d.</i>)
being looked upon as one of the largest. In winter, provisions,
fuel, and clothing, are given in preference to money. The aged
and infirm are admitted into the poor-houses, where, and at the
schools, the children are educated, and afterwards put out to different
trades, till they are able to provide for themselves. The
deacons act gratuitously; and being of the most respectable class
of citizens, elected by the churches to that office, the conscientious
discharge of it is ensured, and in consequence, malversations
seldom take place. The general poor (being inhabitants), including
persons who are and are not members of religious communities
(Jews excepted), are relieved at their own houses from
the revenue of property, long since appropriated to that use,
administered by commissioners appointed by the magistrates, and
acting without emolument (as is the case with most similar
offices in this country), and in aid of which public charitable collections
at private houses are permitted, while any eventful deficiency
is supplied from the funds of the city; but the relief
afforded by these means is very small, and is confined chiefly to
bread, with the addition of fuel in winter. Without other resources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
therefore, or the assistance of private charity, the
claimants could hardly subsist upon what they obtain in this
way. By a decree passed in the year 1818, it was enacted, that
the domicile of a male pauper is the place of his birth, superseded
by the place where he has resided four years and paid taxes; and
that of a child, the residence of his father, or of his mother, if a
widow. That the domicile of a stranger is the place where he
has resided six years; of married women and widows, the place
of their husband’s residence; of legitimate minors, that of their
fathers’, and of illegitimate, that of their mothers’. This decree,
fixing the domicile of paupers for the purpose of obtaining relief,
and a subsequent one, by which gratuitous legal advice is allowed
them, if they apply for it, implies that they have a claim to support,
which can be enforced at law; but as the funds from which
this support must be obtained are uncertain, the amount of the
relief that can be given depends upon their extent, and it is in fact
left at the discretion of the overseers, who have the faculty of
withholding it on the proof of bad conduct of the recipients, or
when their children do not properly attend the school, or have
been neglected to be vaccinated. Those not members of churches
are, moreover, admonished to join some religious community, and
must promise to do so the first opportunity. The decree above
alluded to also regulates the proceedings of one town against another,
and of religious and charitable institutions at the same
place, in respect to paupers. There are at Amsterdam, besides, a
variety of private establishments for the poor of different religious
denominations, endowed by charitable persons, in which the poor
are relieved in different ways, according to prescribed regulations.
<i>In general, the funds of all the public charitable institutions have
greatly diminished, while the number of claimants has much increased,
which causes frequent and urgent appeals to the public
benevolence.</i> In the country, the same system prevails, and the
deacons or office-bearers of the churches are often called upon
during the winter to assist in the support of indigent labourers
with families, till the return of spring enables them to find work;
but there are few permanent poor there, except the old and infirm,
who are generally boarded in poor-houses in the adjoining town.
(p. 582.)</p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be observed that the Consul considers the
law which fixes the domicile of a pauper, and
entitles him to legal advice, as implying in him a
legal right to relief. We understand, however,
that no such right is in practice acknowledged.
And as a large proportion of the fund for the relief
of the poor arises from endowments, the law may
fix the legal settlement of every person, that is, his
right to participate in the endowments of a particular
parish, and allow him legal assistance in
establishing it, without giving to him that indefinite
claim which exists in those countries in which
every person has a right to receive from the public
subsistence for himself and his family.</p>

<p>The official report contains the following details
respecting the funds from which public relief is
afforded: (pp. 573, 574, 575.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The principle which invariably has been acted on is, that the
charge of relieving the poor should in the first place rest on the
overseers of the poor of the religious sects in each parish; but
when the means of the administration of the poor are not sufficient,
they can indiscriminately (without reference to the sect to
which such poor belong) apply to the local administration for
relief, which, after due investigation, generally grants it, according
to the means of the municipal administration, which is regulated
by its direction.</p>

<p>Paupers, however, who are not members of any congregation,
or any religious sect, in the place where they live and receive relief,
or where no ecclesiastical charity for the poor exists, are
supported by the municipal administration of the place where they
live and obtain their support; for which purpose, in several
cities and parishes, a separate administration for the poor is established
responsible to the municipal administration; whereas in
the remaining cities and parishes such relief is granted either by
the burgomaster, or by an overseer of the poor nominated by him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>The hospitals, which in many cities exist, are for the greater
part government establishments, which are administered on account
of the local magistracy, by a number of directors appointed
thereto, in which hospitals all inmates, without any distinction as
to religion, are taken in; some of these hospitals are however
separate foundations, which exist wholly, or in part, on their own
revenues.</p>

<p>Amongst the orphan houses and charities for children and old
people, there are several establishments which exist wholly or in
part on their own revenues; whereas the remainder are generally
the property of particular church administrations of the poor, which
in great cities is almost generally the case in orphan houses, or
charities for children.</p>

<p>Foundlings and abandoned children, at the charge of the place
in which they are abandoned, are provided for in the establishment
for children of the society for charitable purposes; by which
institution the beggars are also provided for in the establishments
appropriated for that purpose, and acknowledged by the government,
at the charge of the place where they have a claim for
relief.</p>

<p>There exist three local workhouses, one at Amsterdam, one at
Middleburgh, and one in the commonalty Nieuwe Pekel A., in the
province of Groningen, in which paupers, generally those who
apply of their own accord, are taken in, upon condition that
they contribute to their support as much as possible by labour: further,
there are in several places twenty-one charitable houses of
industry, which procure work for paupers who are in immediate
want of work, either in the houses of industry, or at their own
dwellings.</p>

<p>Besides the before-mentioned institutions, there are also various
places, unions, and societies, the intentions of which are to grant
relief in some way or other; namely, some for the relief of very
indigent poor; others for granting relief to poor lying-in-women;
and the commissions or societies which during the winter distribute
provisions and fuel.</p>

<p>For the twelve years from 1820 to 1831, the receipts of the
administration for the established charity houses, and those of the
hospitals, taken on an average for each year, amount together;</p>

<p>It appears from this statement that rather more
than 6,000,000 guilders (equal, at 20<i>d.</i> the guilder,
to 500,000<i>l.</i> sterling) has, on an average of the last
12 years, been annually expended on the relief of the
poor, being an expense per head, on an average population

<h4>OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p><i>General Observations.</i>&mdash;Although the persons who have only worked in or for the charitable
work-places, and are not lodged or fed in them, are probably already included
amongst the number of those who have been relieved by the direction of the Poor-house;
it was, however, thought proper not to exclude them from this Table, because the expenses
of procuring work belong likewise to these persons.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> This being the first year in which the establishment at Veere was opened.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> This decrease is occasioned by the removal of able paupers to the Ommerschans.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> This establishment was done away with on the 20th June, and the able paupers were
removed to the Ommerschans, and the invalid paupers to Hoorn.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> This establishment was done away with on the 15th October, all the paupers in it were
removed to the Ommerschans.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears from this table that the number of persons
relieved has steadily increased from 202,015,
the number in 1822, to 279,730, the number in
1831; and that the proportion of paupers to independent
members of society has also increased from
9²³⁰⁄₁₀₀₀ per cent., the proportion in 1822, or rather
more than one-eleventh, to 11⁸⁹⁸⁄₁₀₀₀ per cent., or
rather more than one-ninth, the proportion in 1831:
a proportion exceeding even that of England.</p>

<p>And it is to be observed that the greater part of
this great positive and relative increase of pauperism
has taken place during a period of profound
peace, internal and external; only one of these
years being subsequent to the Belgian revolution.
It is probable that if the years 1832 and 1833 had
been given, the comparison with the earlier period
would have been still more unfavourable.</p>

<p>We have omitted in the statement of the expenditure
for the relief of the poor a sum of 200,000
guilders, or about 16,666<i>l.</i> sterling, annually employed
on the gratuitous instruction of poor children:
the number thus instructed in 1831 was 73,609. It
does not appear, however, that any persons are compelled
to attend to the education of their children,
except by its being made (as is the general rule on
the Continent of Europe) one of the conditions on
which relief is granted: and the Consul states that
the labourers in general think it beneath them to
let their children go to school for nothing; and that
some, when unable to pay, prefer keeping them at
home.</p>

<p>It is remarkable that neither the official nor the
consular report dwells on that portion of the Dutch
poor institutions which has excited the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
attention in Europe, namely, the Poor Colonies.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Poor Colonies.</span></h4>

<p>The following statements are extracted from the
narrative of Count Arrivabene, who visited them in
1829: (pp. 610, 611, 612, 613, 614.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>The dearths of 1816 and 1817, and the consequent distress, occasioned
the establishment, in the northern provinces of the Low
Countries, of a Philanthropic Society (<i>Société de bienfaisance</i>), to
whose funds each subscriber was to pay one halfpenny a week.
The subscribers soon amounted to 20,000. One of its projects was
the foundation of poor colonies among the heaths, with which this
country abounds. The Colonies were to be divided into Colonies
for the Repression of Mendicity, Colonies for Indigent Persons
and Veterans, Free Colonies, Colonies for Inspectors of Agricultural
Works, Colonies for Orphans and Foundlings, and Colonies
for Agricultural Instruction.</p>

<p>In the first year of its formation the Society established the
Free Colony, called Frederiks-Oord, on the heaths between the
provinces of Drenthe, Friesland, and Over-Yssel. It consisted of
52 small farms, part of which had been previously cultivated by
the Society, of a store-house, of several workshops, a school, &amp;c.
It was peopled with families, indigent, but not dependent altogether
on alms. The expense of its foundation amounted to 68,000
flor. (5666<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>), and was defrayed out of the annual
subscriptions and donations of the members of the <i>Société de
bienfaisance</i>; and in order to give employment to the colonists
during the dead season of the year, the Society engaged to purchase
from them 26,000 ells of linen.</p>

<p>In 1819, the Society proposed to the directors of the Orphan
Institutions throughout the kingdom, to take charge, at a fixed
annual payment, of any number of orphans of the age of six years,
leaving to those institutions the right of superintending their treatment.
To meet this expense, the society borrowed 280,000 flor.
(23,333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>). The orphans were for a time placed in separate
dwellings, six orphans with two elderly persons, to act as
their parents, in each. But afterwards almost all were collected
into large buildings. In the same year the members of the society
had increased to 22,500, and their subscriptions to 82,500
flor. or 6875<i>l.</i>, and the society was enabled to establish two other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
free colonies, and to place in them 150 families.</p>

<p>In 1820, the society borrowed 100,000 flor. more, or
8333<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, which, with donations to the amount of 78,000 flor.
or 6500<i>l.</i>, enabled it during that year to settle 150 more families.</p>

<p>In 1821, the society by means of loans and subscriptions had
collected a sum of 421,000 flor. or 35,083<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>, of which
300,000 flor., or 25,000<i>l.</i> was borrowed, and 121,000 flor., or
10,983<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> subscribed, and was possessed of seven free colonies,
consisting of 500 small farms, with the public buildings to
which we have alluded.</p>

<p>In 1822 the society founded the first colony for the repression
of mendicity; and engaged with the Government to receive and
settle on its colonies 4000 orphans, 2500 indigent persons, and
1500 mendicants, the Government engaging to pay for each
orphan 45 florins, or 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> a year, for 16 years, but nothing for
the others. As yet the society has fulfilled only a part of its
engagements. It has, however, established every kind of colony
which we have enumerated.</p>

<h5><i>Frederiks-Oord.</i></h5>

<p>In August, 1829, we visited all the colonies of the society.
Those of Frederiks-Oord are spread over a space of two leagues.
The small farms, containing each about 9 English acres, extend
along the sides of roads, bordered with trees, and of canals,
which intersect the colonies in different directions. Each house
is composed of one great room, round the walls of which are
placed the large drawer-like beds, in which, according to the custom
of the Dutch peasantry, the family sleep. A cow-house, a
barn, and every building necessary for an agricultural family, is
annexed to the farm. Near the house is the garden; beyond it
the land to be cultivated.</p>

<p>Upon his admission into the colony, each colonist makes a
declaration, by which he binds himself to obey its rules, as respects
subordination to its officers, moral and religious conduct on the
part of himself and his family, modes of working, wearing the colonial
uniform, &amp;c.</p>

<p>When a family of 8 persons (the number usually adopted by
the society) has been settled in a farm, the society opens an
account with them, in which they are debited in the sum of 1700
florins, or 141<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>, which is considered as having been
advanced for their use under the following heads:&mdash;</p>

<p>The sum advanced for furniture and clothing is stopped out of
the wages of the colonist; and as soon as the farm has been completely
brought under cultivation, the head of the family is
annually debited 60 florins, or 5<i>l.</i>, as the interest of the remainder
of the capital, and the rent of the farm.</p>

<p>During three years at the least, the colonists cultivate the land
in common, and receive wages, but are allowed to make use of no
part of the produce of the farm; though that of the garden and
the cows is their own. The farm produce (and it appeared to us
to be very trifling), consisting principally of rye, potatoes, and
buck-wheat, is taken to the storehouses of the society to be preserved
for subsequent distribution, either as prepared food or
otherwise, among the colonists, in payment or on account of their
wages.</p>

<p>As long as a family cannot provide its own subsistence, it receives
food daily from the society; but when it can provide for
itself (as it can when it earns 4 flor., or 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> a week), it is
allowed to prepare its food at home.</p>

<p>The society distributes medals of copper, of silver, and of gold.
The first are the rewards of those who distinguish themselves by
regular labour and good conduct, and confer the right to leave
the colony on Sundays and holydays without asking permission.
The second are bestowed on those whose industry supplies their
whole subsistence; they confer the right to leave the colony without
permission, not only on Sundays and holydays, but on every
day of the week, at the hours not devoted to labour. The golden
medals are distributed to those who have already obtained silver
ones, when their farms produce the annual value of 250 flor.
(20<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i>), and upon obtaining them the colonist is no longer
subjected to the strict colonial regimen, though some restrictions
still distinguish him from an ordinary farmer. The medals which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have been obtained by good conduct may be lost or suspended,
with their privileges, by misbehaviour. They are solemnly distributed,
and withdrawn every fifteen days.</p>

<p>After a residence of three years in the colony, the colonists are
distributed into three classes:&mdash;1st, That of industrious men who
have received the silver medal: they may continue to cultivate
their farms in common, as before, or, after having discharged their
original debt to the society, may manage them on their own account,
at a rent payable to the society. 2nd. That of colonists
who have received the copper medal: they may manage their
own farms, and dispose of a part of the produce; the other part
must be sent to the magazines of the society, to be applied in
payment of the rent of the farm, in discharge of the original advances,
and in creating a common fund. A portion of it, however, is
returned to them in bread. But if in any year a colonist does not
raise a given quantity of potatoes, or if he requires from the society
extraordinary assistance, he is forced to restore his medal, and to
return to the third class. 3. This last class, which is composed of
those who have obtained no medal, must, in addition to what is
required from the others, render to the magazines of the society a
greater amount of produce, and have therefore less for their own
use.</p>

<p>A certain extent of ground is cultivated in common by the
colonists, each head of a family being required to work on it three
days in the year, at wages paid in a colonial paper money. The
produce of this common land is employed in supplying the deficiencies
of the harvests of the separate farms, and meeting the
expenses of the school, the hospital, and the general Administration.
The colonists are also allowed in summer to pasture
their cattle in the common pastures of the colony. There are
several shops for the sale, at prices fixed by the Administration,
of whatever the colonists are likely to want, except spirituous
liquors, the use of which is prohibited.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the length of time during which the
colonist has resided in the colony he can never become the proprietor
of his farm. He may, however, acquire the ownership of
his furniture, and sell it or remove it when he quits the colony.</p>

<p>No colonist is allowed to marry unless he be a widower, or the
son of a widower, and in possession of a farm. When his
children have attained 16 or 18 years of age, they choose a trade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
(etat) with the consent of their parents and the colonial authorities,
and may follow it either in the colony or elsewhere.</p>

<p>To every 25 farms there is a superintendent, who visits them
daily, and directs and distributes among the colonists the labours
of the day; and to every 100 farms a sub-director, who gives
instructions to the superintendent, keeps the registers, and
manages the manufactures.</p>

<p>In selecting the occupiers of each subdivision of 25 farms,
care is taken that persons of different trades shall be included.
The superintendence to which a family is subjected diminishes
day by day with its good conduct, and ceases almost entirely as
soon as the colonist has repaid the value of the advances which
have been made to him. Those who are idle or disorderly are
taken before a council of superintendence, of which some colonists
are members, and may be sent on to a council of discipline, which
has the power to transfer them to Ommerschans, a colony for the
repression of mendicity; of which we shall speak hereafter.
They are detained there for a fixed period, in a place set apart for
them, and kept to more than usually hard labour. The industrious
and well-disposed colonists are appointed superintendents of
the works in the colonies for the repression of mendicity, and in
those for the reception of orphans and indigent persons.</p>

<p>Most of the inhabitants of Frederiks-Oord are Protestants;
there are, however, several Catholic and two Jewish families.</p>

<h5><i>Wateren.</i></h5>

<p>In the morning of the 3d day we went to Wateren, which is
two leagues from Frederiks-Oord. Wateren is the colony of
Agricultural Instruction, to which are sent the orphans who most
distinguish themselves in their colonies. They amount to 60,
and acquire agricultural knowledge from a master, and from the
practice of working at a farm of 42 bonniers (nearly 103 acres)
in arable, nursery grounds, and pasture. They are instructed by
the same master in the Bible, the history of Holland, land surveying,
natural-history, botany, mathematics, chemistry, and
gymnastics. They are better dressed than the others, and wear a
hat with a riband, on which is written the name of the privileged
colony to which they belong. Their destination is to become
superintendents in the free colonies. The society derives from
this colony an annual profit of about 900 flor. or 75<i>l.</i></p>

<h5><i>Veenhuisen.</i></h5>

<p>On the same day, after a journey of three leagues, we arrived
at Veenhuisen, which contains one colony for the repression of
mendicity, two for orphans, one for indigent persons and veterans,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and one for inspectors of agricultural works. They are intersected
by high ways, bordered by trees and by canals communicating
with Amsterdam. Two great square buildings, at the distance of
a half mile from each other, contain, in the part which looks into
the interior quadrangle, the one mendicants, the other orphans,
and each contains, in the rooms on the exterior, indigent persons
and veterans. Another similar edifice, at two miles distance,
contains all these three classes of individuals. In the midst of the
three edifices are situated two churches, one Catholic, the other
Protestant; twenty-four houses forming a colony of inspectors of
agricultural works, and an equal number of houses inhabited by
the officers of the colonies.</p>

<p>The children and grown-up persons have been placed thus near
one another for convenience, with respect both to their agricultural
and manufacturing employments.</p>

<p>The interior of each of the three great edifices is divided into two
sides, one for the males, the other for the females, separated by the
kitchen. On the ground-floor are large rooms, containing each
forty or fifty individuals. The upper floors are mere lofts, and
used as store-rooms.</p>

<p>The persons placed in the colonies for the repression of mendicity
receive a new and uniform dress, and for some time are
maintained without reference to the value of their work. Their
out-doors employment consists of agricultural labor, brick-making,
or turf-cutting: in-doors they work as artizans, generally by piece
work. The society fixes the amount of their wages.</p>

<p>The lands of these colonies are divided into farms of thirty-two
bonniers, or about eighty acres each, half arable, half pasture. To
each of these farms are attached forty or fifty colonists, who work
under the orders of a superintendent, who himself follows the instructions
of a sub-director. The annual expenditure on each of these
farms is fixed at 1680 flor., or 140<i>l.</i></p>

<p>The accounts between the society and the colonists are kept in
the military form. Each colonist carries a book, in which is
entered the work which he has performed each day, the supplies
and paper money which he has received, and his share of the
general expenditure. If his earnings exceed what has been laid
out on him, which is said to be commonly the case, a third of the
excess is given to him in paper money, another third is placed in
a savings’ bank, to be given him on his leaving the colony, and
the remaining third is retained by the society to meet contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
expenses.</p>

<p>Horse-patrols round the colonies, rewards to such as bring
back colonists who have attempted to escape, and a uniform dress
are the means employed to prevent desertion. The colonists are
detained for 6 years, unless they have previously saved 12½ flor.
(1<i>l.</i> 10<i>d.</i>), which entitles them to immediate discharge.</p>

<p>Orphans are admitted in the orphan colonies at the age of six.
They work, either in-doors or in the fields, for a part of the day,
another part is employed in elementary instruction, drawing,
and singing. They leave the colonies at the age of 18, generally
for the sea or land service.</p>

<p>The colonies for indigent persons and veterans serve as preparatory
residences for those who are to be placed in the free colonies.
These colonists dwell with their families in the outer apartments
of the great buildings, the interior quadrangles of which are inhabited
by the mendicants and orphans. Like the mendicants,
they are considered day labourers, and paid according to their
work.</p>

<p>In every colony the supplies and wages vary according to the
difference of age, strength, or sex. The men are divided into
5 classes, the women into 7. The first class of men is supposed
to earn 1 flor. 70 cents, or 2<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i> per week; the second, 1 flor.
35 cents, or 2<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; the third, 1 flor. 6 cents, or 1<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>; the
fourth, composed of children from 8 to 16 years, 1 flor. 1 cent, or
1<i>s.</i> 8½<i>d.</i>; the fifth, composed of children under that age, 67½
cents, or 1<i>s.</i> 1½<i>d.</i> The first class of females is supposed to earn
per week 1 flor. 51 cents, or 2<i>s.</i> 6¼<i>d.</i>; the second, 1 flor. 26 cents,
or 2<i>s.</i> 1<i>d.</i>; the third, 98 cents, or 1<i>s.</i> 7½<i>d.</i>; the fourth and fifth,
composed of children, 95 cents, or 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>, and 75 cents, or
1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> respectively; the sixth and seventh, composed also of
children, but still younger, 63 cents, or 1<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i>, and 55 cents,
or 11<i>d.</i>, respectively.</p>

<h5><i>Ommerschans.</i></h5>

<p>On the morning of the fourth day we went to Ommerschans,
which is seven leagues from Veenhuisen.</p>

<p>At Ommerschans there is a colony for the repression of mendicity,
and one for indigent persons and veterans. The first is
composed of men and children; and has a separate division for
the free colonists who have been sent thither as a punishment.
The building can contain 1000 persons, and resembles in several
respects those in Veenhuisen, except that its moat, and the iron-bars
to its windows give it more the appearance of a prison;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
and that it has a story above the ground floor. Nor does it differ
as to its interior arrangement, or the employment or treatment of
its inmates. In the middle of the quadrangle there are shops for
locksmiths, joiners, and other trades; and for the manufacture of
thread and linen. On the outside stands the church, which serves
for both Catholic and Protestant worship, and as a school; the
house of the sub-director, the hospital, and other public edifices;
and 20 houses scattered about the lands, form a colony of inspectors
of agricultural works. Nearly 150 persons are annually
discharged from this colony for the repression of mendicity.</p>

</div>

<p>On recurring to the official statement of the total
number of persons relieved during the ten years
ending 1831, it will be seen that in 1831 the population
of the poor colonies consisted of 7853,
being an increase of 402 from the time of Count
Arrivabene’s visit, arising solely from an increased
number placed in the repressive or most severe of
the penal colonies; and that this population was
thus distributed: 2297 in the colony assigned to
orphans and abandoned children; 456 in the preparatory
colony; 2694 in the colonies called free;
and 2406 in the repressive or mendicity colonies.</p>

<p>The nature of these institutions appears to have
been imperfectly understood in England. They
are in fact large agricultural workhouses; and superior
to the previous workhouses only so far as
they may be less expensive, or, without being oppressive,
objects of greater aversion.</p>

<p>It is scarcely possible that they can be less expensive.</p>

<p>The employing persons taken indiscriminately
from other occupations and trades, almost all of
them the victims of idleness and misconduct, and
little urged by the stimulus of individual interest
in farming the worst land in the country, (land so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
worthless that the fee-simple of it is worth only
24<i>s.</i> an acre,) at an expense for outfit, exclusively
of the value of the land, of more than 130<i>l.</i> per
family, and under the management of a joint-stock
company of more than 20,000 members, cannot but
be a ruinous speculation.</p>

<p>Nor does the institution appear to have repressed
pauperism by the disagreeableness of the
terms on which it offers relief: we have seen, on
the contrary, that it has not prevented its steady
increase. It will be shown subsequently that a
similar establishment has signally failed in Belgium,
and we cannot anticipate a different result in
Holland.</p>

<hr />

<h3>BELGIUM AND FRANCE.</h3>

<p>M. Lebau, the Belgian Minister of Justice, has
furnished a detailed report on the poor laws of
Belgium, together with a considerable number of
printed documents. Of the latter, we have printed
only the regulations of the schools for the poor in
Louvain, and of the out-door relief in Tournay;
the laws of August, 1833, respecting the Dépôts de
Mendicité; and some statistical papers respecting
the relief afforded in different manners in 1833, and
in some of the preceding years. The others were
too voluminous for this publication; and though we
have consulted them (particularly the Code Administratif
des Etablissemens de Bienfaisance,
M. Quetelet’s statistical works on the Netherlands
and Belgium, and M. Ducpétiaux’s on Indigence,)
with great advantage, we have been forced to omit
them. Baron de Hochepied Larpent and Mr. Fauche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
His Majesty’s Consuls in Antwerp and Ostend, have
given valuable replies to the Commissioners’ questions;
and Count Arrivabene a detailed account of
the state of Gaesbeck, a village a few miles from
Brussels. And we have inserted three reports as
to the state of the Belgian poor colonies; one from
Count Arrivabene, who visited them in 1829, and
one from M. Ducpétiaux, and another from Captain
Brandreth, both dated in 1832.</p>

<p>The union and subsequent separation of Belgium
and France, and afterwards of Belgium and Holland,
occasion the Belgian laws on this as on every
other subject to be divisible into three heads:</p>

<p>First, those which she received when incorporated
with France; secondly, those which were
made during the union with Holland; and thirdly,
those which have been passed since the revolution
of 1830.</p>

<p>By far the largest portion of the Belgian poor
laws is derived from the first of these sources.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">French Poor Laws.</span></h4>

<p>The government of the Directory, by three laws
passed in the autumn of 1796, established the
system under which the principal portion of the
relief afforded by the public is now regulated in
most of the countries which constituted the French
empire.</p>

<h5>Hospices and Bureaux de Bienfaisance.</h5>

<p>By the first of these, that of the 16 Vendémiaire,
An v. (7th October, 1796), the property belonging
to the hospices (or almshouses) was restored to
them, and their management was entrusted to a
commission appointed by the municipal authorities.</p>

<p>By the second, that of the 23 Brumaire, An v.
(13th November, 1706), it was enacted, that all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
revenues of the different hospices in one commune
should be employed as one fund for their common
support.</p>

<p>And by the third, that of the 7 Frimaire, An v.
(25th November, 1796), that in every commune
there should be appointed one or more bureaux de
bienfaisance, each bureau consisting of five members,
to administer out-door relief; and that the
funds at the disposition of the bureau de bienfaisance
should consist of one-tenth of the receipts
from all public exhibitions within its district, and
of whatever voluntary contributions it could obtain.
By the same law all able-bodied beggars were required,
under pain of three months’ imprisonment,
to return to their place of birth, or of domicile, if
they had subsequently acquired a domicile.</p>

<p>By the law of the 3 Frimaire, An vii. (23d November,
1798), the additional sums necessary to
provide for the hospices, and the secours à domicile
(or out-door relief), of each commune, are directed
to be raised by the local authorities in the same
manner as the sums necessary for the other local
expenses.</p>

<p>By that of the 4 Ventose, An ix. (23d February,
1801), all rents belonging to the State, of which
the payment had been interrupted, and all national
property usurped by individuals, were declared the
property of the nearest hospitals. By that of the
5 Prairial, An xi., the commissaires des hospices
and bureaux de bienfaisance were authorized to
make public collections in churches, and to establish
poor-boxes in public places; and by a train
of subsequent legislation they were enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
acquire property by testamentary dispositions.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that under these laws the
members of the commissions des hospices, and of
the bureaux de bienfaisance, are frequently, but not
necessarily, the same persons. The maire (or principal
civil officer) of each commune is a necessary
member of every charitable board. The other members
go out by lot, one every year, but are re-eligible.</p>

<p>By the law of the 16 Messidor, An vii., the inmates
of the hospices were to be set to work, and
two-thirds of the produce of their work was to
belong to the hospice, the other third to be given
to them either periodically or when they quitted
the hospice. We mention this enactment, because
it has afforded a precedent for many similar regulations.</p>

<p>And partly for the purpose of increasing the
funds for charitable purposes, and partly with a
view to reduce the rate of interest in the mode of
borrowing usually adopted by the poor, by two
arrêtés of the 16 Pluviose and 24 Messidor, An xii.
(6th February and 13th July, 1804), all pawn-broking
by individuals was prohibited, and public
establishments for that purpose, under the name of
Monts-de-Piété, were directed to be established and
conducted for the benefit of the poor.</p>

<h5>Foundlings and deserted children.</h5>

<p>The French legislation respecting foundlings and
deserted children is of a very different kind, and
appears to us to be the portion of their poor laws
deserving least approbation.</p>

<p>A law of the 27 Frimaire, An v. (17 Dec., 1796),
enacted, that all recently-born deserted children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
should be received gratuitously in all the hospices
of the Republic, at the expense of the State so far
as those hospices had not a sufficient revenue specially
destined to that purpose; and an arrêté of
the Directory, of the 30 Ventose, An v., (20th
March, 1791), founded on the previous law, directed
that as soon as possible after children had been received
in any hospice they should be sent out to be
nursed, and brought up in the country until the age
of 12; and then either left to those who had brought
them up, if they chose to take charge of them, or
apprenticed to farmers, artists, or manufacturers,
or, if the children wished it, to the sea service.</p>

<p>The law on this subject received nearly its
present form from an Imperial decree of the 19th
Jan., 1811.</p>

<p>By that decree, the children for whom the public
became responsible were divided into three classes:
1. Enfans trouvés; 2. Enfans abandonnés; 3. Orphelins
pauvres. The first class comprises children
of unknown parents, found exposed, or placed in
foundling hospitals. The second, children whose
parents are known, but have abandoned them, and
cannot be forced to support them. The third,
children without father or mother, or means of
subsistence. For the first class a hospice was
directed to be appointed in every arrondissement,
with a tour (or revolving slide) for their reception,
without the detection of the person bringing them.
All the three classes of children were to be put out
to nurse until six years old, and then placed with
landholders (cultivateurs) or artizans until 12, subject
to any mode in which the Ministre de la Marine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
might dispose of them. If not wanted by him,
they were at 12 to be apprenticed for periods not
exceeding their attaining the age of 25.</p>

<p>The annual sum of four millions (160,000<i>l.</i>) in
the whole was to be contributed by the State towards
these expenses. The remainder to be supplied by
the hospices out of their own revenues or out of
those of the communes.</p>

<p>Relatives claiming a foundling were to repay all
that it had cost, as far as they had the means.</p>

<p>The last clause of this decree directs that those
who make a custom of taking infants to hospitals
shall be punished according to law. It is not easy
to reconcile this clause with the rest of the decree.
If taking an infant to a foundling hospital were an
offence, it seems strange that the law should itself
prescribe a contrivance (a tour), the object of which
is to prevent the detection of the person committing
the offence. In fact, however, no such punishment
“according to law” seems to exist. If a nurse
or other person entrusted with a child take it, in
breach of duty, to a foundling hospital, the offence
is punishable by the code pénal; but no punishment
is denounced against a parent for doing so,
however often the act may be repeated. Nor does
the “making a custom of taking children to a hospital”
appear as an offence in the detailed “Compte
général de l’administration de la justice criminelle
en France.”</p>

<h5>Mendicity and Vagrancy.</h5>

<p>The following is an outline of the French regulations,
as far as they affected Belgium, for the repression
of mendicity and vagrancy. A decree of
the Convention, 27 Vendémiaire, An ii. (15th Oct.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
1798), fixed the settlement, or domicile de secours,
of every person, 1st, in the place of his birth; 2dly,
of his residence for six months in any commune in
which he should have married, or for one year in
any in which he should have been registered as an
inhabitant, or for two years in any in which he
should have been hired by one or more masters.
Every person found begging was to be sent to his
place of domicile; if he could not prove any domicile
he was to be imprisoned for a year in the
maison de repression of the department, and at the
end of his imprisonment, if his domicile were not
then ascertained, to be transported to the colonies
for not less than eight years. A person found again
begging after having been removed to his domicile,
was also to be imprisoned for a year: on a repetition
of the offence the punishment was to be
doubled. In the maison de repression he was to
be set to work, and receive monthly one-sixth of
the produce of his labour, and at the end of his
imprisonment another sixth, the remaining two-thirds
belonging to the establishment. On the
third offence he also was to be transported. A
transport was to work in the colonies for the benefit
of the nation, at one-sixth of the average wages of
the colony: one-half of that sixth to be paid to him
weekly, and the other half on the expiration of his
sentence. No person was to be transported except
between the ages of 18 and 60. Those under 18
were to be detained until they arrived at that age,
and then transported; those above 60, to be imprisoned
for life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>The local authorities were authorized to employ
their able-bodied poor on public works, at three-fourths
of the average wages of the canton. Every
person convicted of having given to a beggar any
species of relief whatever was to forfeit the value
of two days’ wages; to be doubled on the repetition
of the offence.</p>

<p>The provisions of this law were, as might have
been anticipated, far too severe for execution. After
having remained, though inoperative, on the statute
book for nearly 15 years, it was replaced by the
Imperial decree of the 5th July, 1808.</p>

<p>By that decree a depôt de mendicité was directed
to be established in each department, at the expense
partly of the nation and partly of the department.
Within 15 days after its establishment, the
Prefect of the department was to give public notice
of its being opened, and all persons without means
of subsistence were bound to proceed to it, and all
persons found begging were to be arrested and
taken to it.</p>

<p>By a subsequent arrêté of the 27th October,
1808, it was ordered that all beggars should on
their arrest be placed in the first instance in the
maison d’arrêt of the district; and transferred from
thence, if guilty of vagrancy, to the maison de detention,
or prison; if not vagrants, to the depôt de
mendicité. In the depôt they were to be clothed
in the house dress, confined to regular and very
early hours, the sexes separated, subject to severe
punishments (rising to six months’ solitary imprisonment
(cachot) on bread and water) for disobedience
or other misconduct, or attempts to escape;
deprived of all intercourse, except by open letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
with their relations or friends, and kept to work at
wages to be regulated by the Prefect, two-thirds of
which were to belong to the establishment, and the
remaining third was to be paid to them on their
quitting the depôt.</p>

<p>The conditions on which a person might obtain
his release from a depôt de mendicité are not
stated.</p>

<p>The provisions of the code pénal appear to leave
that question to the discretion of the Executive.</p>

<p>Section 274 of that code enacts that every person
found begging in a place containing a public
establishment for the prevention of mendicity, shall
be imprisoned for from three to six months, and
then removed to the depôt de mendicité. Under
section 275, if there be no such establishment in
the place where he is found begging, his imprisonment
is to last only from one to three months; if,
however, he has begged out of the canton in which
he is domiciled, it is to last from six months to two
years.</p>

<p>After having suffered his punishment, he is to
remain (apparently in the depôt de mendicité) at
the disposition of Government.</p>

<hr />

<h3>BELGIUM.</h3>

<h4>Monts-de-Piété.</h4>

<p>Such was the state of the law respecting purely
charitable, and what may be called penal, relief at
the time of the establishment of the kingdom of
the Netherlands. We have stated these provisions
at some length, because they form, with little material
alteration, the existing law on the subject in
France. No change of any importance appears to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
have been made by the late Government of the
Netherlands, or by the present Belgian Government,
with respect to the hospices or the bureaux
de bienfaisance; but with respect to foundlings,
an arrêté of the 2nd June, 1825, declared that the
expense of their maintenance ought to be supplied
by the hospices, and so far as these were unable to
meet it, from the local revenues of the commune or
the province in which they had been abandoned&mdash;a
provision which has been the subject of much
complaint, as imposing a heavy and peculiar burthen
on the few towns which possess foundling
hospitals. And with respect to monts-de-piété, an
arrêté of the 31st October, 1826, directed the local
authorities of towns and communes to prepare
regulations for the management of their respective
monts-de-piété, their support, and the employment
of the profits, subject to certain general rules;
among which are,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. That the administration shall be gratuitous.</p>

<p>2. That the interest shall not exceed 5<i>l.</i> per cent.
per annum, and that no farther charge shall be
made on any pretext whatever.</p>

<p>3. That they shall be open every day.</p>

<p>4. That the pledges may be redeemed at any
time before their actual sale.</p>

<p>5. That they shall not be sold until the expiration
of 14 months from the time of the loan.</p>

<h4>Mendicity.</h4>

<p>The following are the most material alterations
made in the laws respecting mendicity. By a law
of the 28th November, 1818, the period of residence
necessary for acquiring a settlement, or
domicile de secours, was extended to four years:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
and by a law of the 12th October, 1819, the expense
of supporting a person confined in a depôt
de mendicité was thrown on the commune in which
he had his domicile de secours.</p>

<p>In 1823 the Belgian Société de Bienfaisance
was established, on the model of that which existed
in Holland, and contracted with the Government
to receive in its colonies de repression 1000
paupers, at the annual sum of 35 florins (2<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i>
4<i>d.</i>) per head. In consequence of this arrangement,
all the regulations which required a beggar
to be removed to a depôt de mendicité were varied
by the introduction of the words “or to a mendicity
colony;” and by an arrêté of the 12th October,
1825, the governors of the different provinces were
directed to give notice that all persons in want of
employment and subsistence would obtain them in
the depôts de mendicité, or the mendicity colonies,
and had only to apply to the local authorities in
order to be directed to the one or the other; and
that consequently no begging at any period of the
year, or under any pretext whatever, could in future
be tolerated. Persons arrested for begging were
allowed on their own request, if their begging were
not accompanied by aggravating circumstances, to
be conducted to one or the other of these establishments
without suffering the previous imprisonment
inflicted by the penal code.</p>

<p>By another arrêté of the same date, the local
authorities were directed to prepare new codes for
the regulation of the different depôts de mendicité,
based on principles of which the following are the
most material:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>1. That the depôts should be confined to the
reception of those who, from age or infirmity,
should be unfit for agricultural labour.</p>

<p>2. That all above the age of six, and under that
of 70, and capable of working, should be kept to
work, at average wages; that each person should be
charged per day 17 cents (about 3½<i>d.</i>) for his maintenance,
being its average cost, and retain the
remainder of his earnings; and be allowed nothing
beyond strict necessaries (mere bread is specified
for food), if his earnings were under that sum.</p>

<p>That a portion of each person’s surplus earnings
should be reserved and paid over to him on leaving
the house, and the other portion paid to him from
time to time in a local paper money.</p>

<p>3. That cantines should be established in the
house, to enable the inmates to spend their surplus
earnings.</p>

<p>4. That those who had voluntarily offered themselves
for reception should be at liberty to quit the
house, after having repaid the expenses of their
maintenance there.</p>

<p>5. That those arrested and sent thither as beggars
should not be set free until, 1st., they had
repaid all expenses; and 2ndly, had fitted themselves
to earn an independent livelihood, or been
demanded by their commune or relatives, and security
given for their future conduct.</p>

<p>6. That in each house there should be an ecclesiastic
to perform divine service, and give moral
and religious instruction, frequently in private, and
twice a week in public; and that, where the inmates
should consist of Protestants and Catholics,
there should be both a Catholic and a Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
ecclesiastic.</p>

<p>7. That in each house there should be a daily
school for the young, and a school for the adult,
open for four hours on Sundays, and for an hour
two evenings of the week. The attendance on these
schools to be compulsory.</p>

<p>8. That so far as the confined paupers did not
earn their own subsistence, each commune should
pay for the support of those having in it their domicile
de secours, at the above-mentioned rate of
17 cents. (3½<i>d.</i>) per day, but be allowed a discount
of 2 cents. per day (reducing the daily payment
to 3<i>d.</i>) on prompt payment.</p>

<p>A decree of the 9th April, 1831, by the Regent,
abolished that discount, the sum of 3<i>d.</i> a day having
been found insufficient, except in the depôt of
Bruges, in which the decree states that it covers
every expense.</p>

<p>The existing Government has passed two very
important laws, dated the 13th &amp; 29th of August,
1833.</p>

<p>The first of these enacts, that until the laws on
mendicity shall have been revised, the daily charge
for the subsistence of each detenu in the depôt de
mendicité, instead of being fixed at 17 cents., shall
be determined annually by the Government. The
commune bound to repay the expense is to be
assisted, if incapable of meeting it, by the province,
the King deciding if the matter is disputed. If
payment is not made, a personal remedy is given
against the receiver of the commune.</p>

<p>By the second, a conseil d’inspection des depôts
de mendicité is to be elected in each province.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
Each conseil is to propose a scheme,&mdash;</p>

<p>1. For dividing the inmates of the depôts into
three classes, comprising, 1st, the infirm; 2d, the
able-bodied who have voluntarily entered them;
3d, those sentenced to them as beggars or vagrants.</p>

<p>2. For obviating the abuses which might follow
from the power given to the indigent of voluntarily
entering the depôts.</p>

<p>And as a general rule, a pauper who requests
admission without any authority from his commune,
may be received; but in that case his commune is
to be immediately informed of what has occurred.
If it offers to support him at home, he is to be sent
back to it: if it refuses, he is to remain in the
depôt at the expense of the commune: and the
communes are to be informed that it depends on
themselves to diminish the expense of supporting
their poor in the depôts, by the judicious distribution
of out-door relief, by the organization of committees
for the purpose of watching over the indigent, and
inquiring into the causes of their distress; by the
erection of asylums for lunatics, the deaf and dumb,
the blind and the incurable; and by the establishment
of houses of employment (d’ateliers libres de
travail) in winter, and infant schools. For all
which purposes they are recommended to assess
themselves. M. Lebeau says in his report, “Enfin
chez, nous nul ne peut exiger de secours en
vertu d’un droit.”<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> (p. 594.) But it must be admitted
that these provisions, if not constituting a
right in the pauper to relief, give at least a right
to the managers of the depôts to force the parishes
to relieve, either at home or in the depôt, any pauper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
who presents himself: and M. Lebeau himself
felt the danger to which the parishes are exposed.
In his circular of the 13th September, 1833, addressed
to the provinces in which depôts are established,
he urges the importance of adopting regulations
respecting the reception and dismission of
the poor voluntarily presenting themselves, which
may preserve parishes from “the indefinite burden
which would follow the too easy admission of
applicants.” “These establishments,” he adds,
“must not be considered by the poor as places of
gratuitous entertainment, (des hôtelleries gratuites.)
One of the best methods of preventing this will be
the strict execution of the law which prescribes
work to all those who are not physically incapable
of it; and for those who are incapable, the ordinary
hospices and hospitals are the proper receptacles.
It is true that in some depôts work has been discontinued,
because the results did not repay the
expenditure; but this consideration ought not to
prevail over the moral advantages which follow its
exaction. Labour is the essential condition which
must be imposed on the pauper; and if it require
the sacrifice of some expenditure, that sacrifice must
be made.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent circular, dated the 4th July,
1834, and addressed to the governors of the different
provinces, M. Lebeau states, that one of the
causes assigned for the prevalence of mendicity, is
the facility with which persons obtain release from
the depôts. “I invite you, M. le Gouverneur,”
says the Minister, “when a pauper requests his
release, to consider his previous history, to ascertain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
whether he has the means of subsistence, or
the local authorities have engaged to provide for
him; and to treat with great suspicion the solicitations
of parishes, as they are always interested in
obtaining the release of the paupers for whose maintenance
they pay.”</p>

<p>With respect to the general working of these
institutions we have not much information. It appears
from the report of M. Lebeau that there are
in Belgium six depôts de mendicité; one at Hoogstraeten
for the province of Antwerp, at Cambre for
Brabant, at Bruges for the two Flanders, at Mons
for Hainault, at Namur for Namur and Luxembourg,
and at Reckheim for Limbourg and Liege;
that the hospices for the old and impotent, and the
hospitals for the sick, are very numerous, and that
nearly every commune possesses its bureau de bienfaisance
for the distribution of out-door relief. In
1832 the annual income of the different bureaux de
bienfaisance was estimated at 5,308,114 francs
(equal to about 212,325<i>l.</i> sterling), and that of
the hospices at 4,145,876 francs (equal to about
165,835<i>l.</i> sterling), altogether about 378,160<i>l.</i>
But the report contains no data from which the
whole expenditure in public relief, or the whole
number of persons relieved, or the general progress
or diminution of pauperism, can be collected.</p>

<p>An important paper, however, is contained in the
supplement to M. Lebeau’s report, stating the
number of foundlings, deserted children and orphans,
in the nine provinces constituting the kingdom
of Belgium, in the years 1832 and 1833; of
which we subjoin a copy, having added to it the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
population of the different provinces, as given in

<h4>Foundlings.</h4>

<p>It appears from this statement that in the provinces
of Antwerp, Brabant, and Hainault, containing
a population of 1,514,072 persons, and possessing
each two public receptacles for foundlings,
the number of foundlings in 1833 was 5,404, or 1 in
278: that in Flandre Orientale and Namur, containing
a population of 946,663, and possessing
each a single public receptacle, the number of
foundlings was 1367, or 1 in 699; and that in
Flandre Occidentale, Liége, Limbourg and Luxembourg,
containing a population of 1,601,469, but
having no such establishment, the number of foundlings
was 98, or less than 1 in 16,000. Nor does
this difference arise from an increased number of
deserted children in those provinces in which
foundling hospitals do not exist: on the contrary,
the numbers in the second column, comprising both
orphans and deserted children, in the four provinces
in which no foundling hospitals exist, amount to
910, out of a population of 1,601,469, being 1 in
1649, whereas those in Antwerp, Brabant and
Hainault amount to 1356, out of a population of
1,514,077, or 1 in 116; and when it is recollected
that the proportion of orphans can scarcely differ
in the different provinces, and that in the second
column they are mixed with the deserted children,
the superiority of the four former provinces over
the three latter will be found to be really much
greater than it appears.</p>

<p>Nor does the difference arise from the prevalence
of infanticide.</p>

<p>It appears from the statistique des tribunaux de
la Belgique, that in the years 1826, 1827, 1828,
and 1829, there were in the provinces of Antwerp,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
Brabant, Flandre Orientale, Hainault, and Namur,
containing 2,450,740 inhabitants, and possessing
foundling establishments, 13 convictions for infanticide;
and in Flandre Occidentale, Liege, Limbourg,
and Luxembourg, containing 1,601,469 inhabitants,
and no such establishments, only nine
convictions, being a proportion slightly inferior. So
far, therefore, from foundling hospitals having had
a tendency to prevent desertion of children, or infanticide,
it appears that their tendency is decidedly
to promote the former, without preventing in any
degree the latter. The real infanticides, strange as
it may sound, are the founders and supporters of
foundling hospitals. The average mortality in
Europe of children during the first year does not
exceed one in five, or 20 per cent. In England
and Holland it is less: in Belgium it is 22⁴⁹⁄₁₀₀, per
cent. But in the foundling hospitals of Belgium
(and their mortality is below the average of such
establishments), it is 45 per cent.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>In the foundling hospital in Brussels it is now 66
per cent., having been from 1812 to 1817, 79 per
cent.</p>

<p>Nor is the fate of those who escape from these
receptacles much preferable to that of those who
perish there. M. Ducpétiaux, the inspector of
prisons, states that, small as is their number relative
to the rest of the population, they form a considerable
proportion of the inmates of gaols and prisons,
and a still larger proportion of the prostitutes.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>Such having been the legislation, and such being
its results, an attempt towards its improvement was
made by a law, dated the 30th July, 1834. That
laws enacts, that from the 1st of January, 1835, the
maintenance of foundlings and of deserted children
whose place of settlement is not known, shall be
supplied one half by the communes in which they
shall have been exposed or deserted, with the assistance
of their bureaux de bienfaisance, and the
other half by the province of which those communes
form a part, and that an annual grant shall be made
by the State in aid of this expenditure; and that the
expense of maintaining deserted children whose
place of settlement is known, shall be supported by
the hospices and bureaux de bienfaisance of their
place of settlement, with the assistance of the
commune.</p>

<p>The object of this law is stated in a circular from
the Minister of Justice, dated the 23d January,
1834.</p>

<p>He directs, in the first place, the local authorities
to provide for the subsistence of the foundlings
with whom they may be charged, without reference
to the proposed annual grant, since neither the
amount of that grant, nor the mode of its distribution,
is laid down by the law; and urges them to
prevent the increase of their own burthens by
endeavouring to prevent the abandonment of children
born within their jurisdictions, and the exposure
within their jurisdictions of children born
elsewhere; and for that purpose to procure the
punishment by law of those convicted of having
exposed infants, or made a custom of taking them
to hospitals. He admits, however, that the necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
investigations are matters of great delicacy;
and he might have added that the punishment by
law to which he refers does not exist, unless punishment
by law means the arbitrary interference of the
police, so much tolerated in continental Europe.</p>

<p>“These,” he adds, “are the wishes of the Government
and of the Chambers; and this declaration
will enable you to understand the motives of
the silent repeal of the law, directing the establishment
of tours for the reception of foundlings. The
Legislature could not at the same time prescribe
measures intended to diminish the exposure of
children, and an institution by which it is favoured
and facilitated. It did not venture to pronounce the
suppression of the existing tours; but the silence
of the law on this subject is the expression of its
earnest desire that this institution should be discontinued;
the mode of discontinuing it is left to the
local authorities. The Government will require
from you an annual report on these subjects, before
it decides on the distribution of the annual grant;
and the favour shown to each district may depend
on its endeavours to comply with these instructions.”</p>

<p>This circular is a curious instance of an attempt to
undermine an institution which the Government and
the Legislature disapprove, but which they do not
venture directly to grapple with. All that the Legislature
ventures directly to do is to express its earnest
desire (désir formel), <i>by the silence of the law</i>. The
Government however goes further, and holds out
hints, though it does not venture to hint very clearly,
that the fewer the foundlings in any district, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
larger will be the share of that district in the government
grant. Under the influence of these
double motives we may expect the tours soon to be
closed.</p>

<p>The number of pledges redeemed is stated only
for 1832, in which year 1,124,115 pledges, on which
3,162,399 francs, or 126,495<i>l.</i> sterling, had been
lent, were redeemed. It is to be observed that the
pledges are for small sums, amounting, on an
average, to about three francs, or less than half-a-crown
per pledge; and that the amount of the redemption
in 1832 nearly corresponds with the
amount lent in 1831. On the whole, considering
the low rate of interest exacted by the Belgian
monts-de-piété, as compared with that taken by our
pawnbrokers, the small aggregate amount of deposits,
being about 150,000<i>l.</i> for four millions of
people, is a strong indication of the generally provident
habits of the labouring population.</p>

<p>As further illustrations of the general working of
the Belgian system, we extract the following particulars
from the reports from Antwerp and Ostend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>

<h5><i>Vagrants.</i></h5>

<p>Indigent travellers, foreigners, or denizens, who pass through
Antwerp, are received there at an establishment called St. Julien’s
Hospital, where they are lodged and boarded for three nights at
the expense of the establishment, which provides their wants for
the moment.</p>

<p>The foundation of this hospital, which yearly receives about
1000 individuals, dates from the beginning of the 14th century.
It subsists by itself, under the direction of a private charitable administration,
by means of some fixed revenues, and also by the
liberal donations of philanthropic persons.</p>

<p>The same poor travellers, when Belgians, receive at Antwerp
an indemnity of 15 centimes, or 1½<i>d.</i> sterling, per league per
head for travelling expenses to the first town in the neighbourhood,
where this relief is continued to them. These travelling expenses
are at the charge of the town, and paid out of the municipal funds,
in virtue of a Royal Act of the 10th May, 1815.</p>

<h5><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h5>

<p>Necessitous individuals of the labouring and indigent class, who
do not attempt to go a begging, and who, for want of work, are
without means of providing for the necessaries of life, and also
the members of their families, are provided for at their own
dwellings, by the care of the bureau de bienfaisance, by the means
or revenues of this establishment, and the subsidies which the
town grants it yearly out of the municipal funds, in order to supply
what may be necessary to continue its service. The amount of
this grant varies annually, according to the real wants of the establishment,
by reason of the circumstances that either augment or
reduce its expenses.</p>

<p>The succours distributed by this establishment consist in money,
bread, potatoes, fuel, and clothing, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Besides, there exists at Antwerp, under the direction of the
same bureau de bienfaisance, a workhouse, where carpets of cow-hair
and other articles are made. This workhouse is established
especially to procure work to the indigent and working class who
are without employ. The population of this establishment varies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
according to the different seasons and other circumstances. It is
most frequented during the winter, when the navigation is interrupted,
and the stagnation of several branches of industry causes
the number of indigent to augment. Those who come to work in
this establishment remain there the whole day, and receive their
meals, besides a salary in cash, proportioned to the work they are
employed at.</p>

<p>If, through the effects of a hard winter, the wants of the labouring
and indigent class are excessive, there are formed at Antwerp
private societies for relief, which, by means of donations, collections,
and voluntary subscriptions, efficaciously assist the unfortunate
by distributions of money, food, fuel, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The depôt of mendicity in the province of Antwerp is situated at
Hoogstraeten, in an ancient manor bought for that purpose by the
former department administration. It is a spacious establishment
of agriculture, possessing a great number of acres of arable, pasture,
and wood land, and a still greater number of heath (bruyère).</p>

<p>Those individuals who are destitute, and who desire to be
admitted into this establishment, are received as free men; the
vagrants are brought there by force. Both are employed there at
sundry works of agriculture, of manufacture, or in the household
establishment, according to their physical strength. The impotent
and aged alone are kept without working in a separate place.</p>

<p>For several years the expense for the maintenance of individuals
of the depôt at Hoogstraeten has not amounted to more than 32
centimes per individual, (or 3<i>d.</i> sterling.)</p>

<p>On the 1st January, 1834, the number of persons entertained
at the provincial depôt, on account of the city of Antwerp, was
153. The population of this establishment generally amounts to
250 or 300 individuals, all belonging to the province.</p>

<p>The children of the working class or indigent are received,
without any distinction, in the public schools established gratis.
Those children abandoned to the public charity, or of whom the
parents are entirely unable to bring them up, and who request to
be relieved of them from inability to maintain them, are sent to an
hospital established for that purpose, or else placed in the country
under the direction of the civil hospital, or the bureau de bienfaisance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h5>

<p>There are at Antwerp 26 private hospitals, founded and established
for many centuries by charitable persons in favour of a
stated number of aged persons, of both sexes, and of decent and
respectable families; but in preference for the members of the
founders’ family, and which persons, without being entirely destitute,
have, notwithstanding, no sufficient means to provide for
their subsistence. Those persons inhabit a small house in the
hospital, where they keep their own household separately, and
subsist by what they can earn personally by any hand-work, and
by the weekly succour which they receive from the revenue of the
foundation. These men and women reside in separate hospitals.</p>

<p>Destitute persons, of both sexes, who are impotent through age,
but have not claims to be admitted into the before-mentioned private
hospital, are maintained by the administrations of the poor, the
sick, incurable, and impotents, in the civil hospital, and the others
in the country, where they are boarded with the farmers at the
expenses of the public establishment of charity; that is to say, of
the administration of the civil hospitals and bureau de bienfaisance.
Besides, there is at Antwerp a special establishment as a refuge
to the impotent through age, of decent and respectable families,
who are without means of procuring a livelihood.</p>

<h5><i>Sick.</i></h5>

<p>In Belgium every town has its civil hospital for the maintenance
of destitute sick. That of Antwerp is open to all the unfortunate,
without distinction, whenever their social position does not afford
them the means of being attended by a physician at their dwellings,
who are deemed proper objects for admission.</p>

<p>Are also admitted, in a private room in this hospital (upon
payment of a small daily retribution), all individuals who, although
not entirely destitute, prefer to be treated in the hospital rather
than at their own houses; such as men and female servants, who
are commonly sent there by the persons who have them in their
employ.</p>

<p>Indigent persons, born at Antwerp, are treated at the hospital
at the expense of the establishment. Those who are not of the
town, but are of the country, are treated there at the expense of
the commune where they have their domicile de secours.</p>

<p>These expenses are fixed at the rate of 62 cents., or 1 franc 31
centimes (1<i>s.</i> 0½<i>d.</i> sterling) per diem, whatever may be the sickness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
The expenses, for the treatment of those who have no
domicile de secours, are repaid by government out of the treasury
funds. The town provides for the insufficiency of the private
revenue of this establishment, in the same manner as it does for
the bureau de bienfaisance, by means of “subsidies in aid,” paid
out of the municipal funds. This amount of “subsidies” varies
annually according to the wants of the administration of the
hospital.</p>

<p>Persons of the indigent and necessitous class, whose sickness
or complaint is not severe enough to require their entering the
hospital, receive medical and surgical relief at their own homes.
To that effect, there are several physicians and surgeons appointed
and attached to the bureau de bienfaisance, who give their assistance
to the sick who require it, every one in the district or section
for which he is appointed. These physicians and surgeons, who
receive a fixed salary from the administration of the poor, also
receive at their domicile, at fixed hours of the day, indigent
persons who want to consult them on the state of their health;
and it is on a ticket delivered by them, that such sick persons are
received at the hospital. The bureau de bienfaisance has a special
pharmacy, situated in the centre of the town, where medicine is
given gratis to the indigent, on a prescription signed by a physician
of the poor establishment.</p>

<p>The indigent persons relieved by the bureau de bienfaisance
receive only the strict necessaries of life to feed and support their
families, and no more, so that they have nothing to satisfy their
private wants or fancies, nor can they procure themselves any
luxuries or other comforts; and they always lead a life, that,
although protected against the most pressing wants, is notwithstanding
a very miserable one. It is thus the interest of those
individuals that are able to work (and this they perfectly comprehend)
to seek to maintain themselves. It is only those persons
who are totally depraved, and who give themselves entirely up to
drunkenness and every other excess, who feel assured that, after
having wasted and spent the little they possess, and abandoned
the work that maintained them, there always remains to them the
resource of the distributions made by the administration of the
poor.</p>

<p>In Antwerp, the situation of a workman, whatever may be the
class he belongs to, and who maintains himself solely by his work,
is by all means preferable and better than that of a person who only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
subsists by relief or public charity. The existence of those who
reside in the depôts of mendicity, excepting only the loss of their
liberty, is even in many respects preferable to the situation of the
latter, who are maintained by general charity.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Ostend.</span></h4>

<div class="sidenote">Population, 11,328.</div>

<h5><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h5>

<p>The only legal mode of lodging the destitute able-bodied is to
send them to the depôt of mendicity, where they are treated as
paupers. There existed formerly agricultural colonies on the
same principles as those in Holland, to which the parishes could
send their able-bodied, destitute, and their families; it was found in
vain to attempt making cultivators or proprietors of them.</p>

<p>The destitute able-bodied, but quite indigent, of the two Flanders,
and the vagrants who have been tried as such, compose altogether
a population of about 300 persons (the destitute able-bodied of
Ghent excepted.) For each of these 300 poor, his parish pays a
contribution of 32 centimes (3<i>d.</i>) per day (men and women
equally.) The depôt for both the Flanders established at Bruges,
by the mildness of its administration, has gradually overcome the
dread which it inspired at its origin. The directors have banished
all rigour, not even enforcing work on the destitute; but as they
are paid according to their industry, that inducement to work is
found sufficient. This establishment is remarkably prosperous,
having already saved fr. 80,000 (3200<i>l.</i>), all expenses paid. It is
not found necessary to have any armed force in the neighbourhood
to keep this large number of destitute in order, this being
attained by gentleness and good usage. On any of the poor
leaving the establishment, improved in their moral conduct, they
receive a part of their own earnings, which enables them to seek
some employment.</p>

<p>Besides this depôt, there is at Ghent a workhouse where employment
is given to the destitute, but without their being maintained.
The number of labourers in this establishment, which was
erected by voluntary subscription, has been as many as 1900 in
time of great distress.</p>

<p>Every church has its masters of the table of the poor, or distributors
of assistance. Such funds proceed from collections made
in the church, voluntary alms, and assignments from the “bureau
de bienfaisance.” Weekly distributions of bread or fuel, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
money or clothing, are made; but this assistance is generally
discontinued in the summer months, on account of the abundance
of work during that season. In the towns the relief consists
principally in money (about 32 centimes per man and per day, or
3<i>d.</i> sterling.) In the country the rule is not to give money, but
assistance in kind.</p>

<p>Generally their children may be educated gratuitously; but they
take little advantage of it, as they prefer employing them in
gathering up firewood, &amp;c.; and, generally, there is felt a want of
coercive measures to force the parents to send their children to
school, and to allow them to be put out as apprentices.</p>

<h5><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h5>

<p>There are almshouses throughout the kingdom, where the
impotent through age are maintained and taken care of. These
institutions are so far profitable to the parishes, as that it would
cost them more money to assist these persons separately. Some
have been endowed by deeds of gift, others are supported by the
inhabitants of the towns. The number of them is increasing in
the country, and most towns are well provided in that respect.</p>

<p>The assistance afforded to those relieved at home is in clothing,
bread, fuel twice a week, and 75 centimes in money (7<i>d.</i>) every
Sunday.</p>

<p>There exists between the self-supporting labourers and the persons
subsisting exclusively on alms or public charity, a very
numerous intermediate class, consisting of those who live partly
on relief and partly on labour, so that the two extremities only of
the scale can be compared. An able-bodied but not labouring
man receives only about the half what the last of those who do
labour and are not assisted would earn; the legal relief being 32
centimes (3<i>d.</i>), and the lowest day’s work more than 64 centimes
(6<i>d.</i>) As to liberty, nobody is forced to work, not even at
the depôt of mendicity; they are only not allowed to go out at
will. Food is almost equally distributed, and many destitute poor
prefer the depôt to free labour, when they are not sure of being
employed every day; but in no other instance.</p>

<p>The grievances which result from this system arise from the
neglect, the ignorance or the corruption of the local authorities,
and although numerous, they are not very striking.</p>

<p>2dly. Grievances arise from the want of proper conditions with
which lands or houses are bequeathed to the bureaux de bienfaisance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Wherever a revenue is bequeathed it is shared equally by
the poor, even when they may be beyond need; for instance, a
beggar will receive 1 fr. 50 c. (1<i>s.</i> 2<i>d.</i>) per day for her maintenance,
which would not have cost more than the fifth part of that
sum if paid by the depôt of mendicity. To obviate this abuse,
and to increase the power of useful charity, the revenue of the
bureau de bienfaisance of each parish should be added to the sum
principal of the province when the revenue of the bureau exceeds
the wants of its locality. 3dly. Grievances arise from the liberty
of parents to neglect their children, and allowing them to beg
alms for their own benefit. This last appears to be the root of the
evil, and the great cause of the augmentation of pauperism in
these towns.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Gaesbeck.</span> (page 1.)</h4>

<p>But the most interesting portion of the Belgian
details is Count Arrivabene’s account of Gaesbeck,
a small village about nine miles from Brussels, containing
about 857 acres, inhabited by 364 persons,
forming 60 families, or separate menages, constituted
of 13 comparatively large farmers, occupying
each from 30 to 150 acres, 18 small proprietors or
small farmers, 21 day-labourers, and 8 artizans. The
commune possesses a property producing an annual
revenue of 556 francs, or nearly 23<i>l.</i> sterling, managed
by its bureau de bienfaisance, of which the
curé is the acting member. It expended in the year
1832, on the relief of the poor, (including the salary
of the schoolmaster and clothing for the poor children
who were to be confirmed,) 625 francs, or about
25<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i>, being rather less than 1<i>s.</i> 4½<i>d.</i> per head.
How the extra 2<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> was obtained is not mentioned;
but as the bureau is stated to have always
nearly a year’s revenue in hand, it was probably
taken from the receipts of a previous year. The
heaviest item of expense is the support of one old
man, at the annual expense of 72 francs, (rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
less than 3<i>l.</i>) Ten other individuals, or heads of
families, appear to have received nearly regular
relief, amounting in general to about 6<i>d.</i> a week;
and four others to have been assisted at times
irregularly; the largest sum being 1<i>l.</i>, given to L.
Maonens, “pour malheur.” There has been only
one illegitimate birth during the last five years.
The average age of marriage is 27 for men, and 26
for women; the average number of births to a marriage,
3½. As these averages are taken for a
period of 23 years, ending in 1832, during which
the population has not increased, they may be
relied on. Of the whole 60 families, only 11 are
without land; all the others either possess some, or
hire some from the proprietor. The quantity generally
occupied by a day-labourer is a bonnier, or
about 2½ acres, for which he pays a rent of from 60
to 80 francs. With this land the labourers keep in
general a cow, a pig, and poultry. To be without
land is considered the extreme of poverty. The
number of labourers is precisely equal to the demand
for their services. Daily wages are 6<i>d.</i>, with
some advantages equal to about 1<i>d.</i> more; and, as
might be expected under a natural system, with
no preference of the married to the unmarried.
Labourers are generally hired by the year, and
remain long in the same service. Crime is exceedingly
rare: for the last 12 years no one has been
committed to prison. Offences against the game
laws are unknown. There are three houses of
entertainment in the village, but they are not
frequented by the labourers. “Are the labourers
discontented; do they look on the farmers with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
envy?” asked the Count of his informant. “I do
not believe,” was the answer, “that the labourers
envy the farmers. I believe that the relation between
the farmers and labourers is very friendly:
that the labourers are perfectly contented in their
situation, and feel regard and attachment for their
employers.” (p. 14.)</p>

<p>What a contrast is exhibited by this picture of
moral, contented, and (if the term is permissible)
prosperous poverty, supported by the frugality and
providence of the labourers themselves, and that of
the population of a pauperized English village,
better fed indeed, better paid, better clothed, and
better lodged, and, above all, receiving 10, or perhaps
20 times the amount of parochial alms, but
depraved by profligacy, soured by discontent, their
numbers swelled by head-money and preference of
the married to double the demand for their labour,
their frugality and providence punished by the refusal
of employment, and their industry ruined by
the scale; looking with envy and dislike on their
masters, and with hatred on the dispensers of relief!</p>

<p>And it is to be observed that the independence
of the Belgian peasantry does not arise from any
unwillingness to accept of relief. Out of the 60
families forming the population of the village, 19
appear to have received it in 1832; and a fact is
related by Count Arrivabene, which shows that
indiscriminate alms are as much coveted there as
with us. In 1830 (the year of the revolution)
many persons applied for charity at the gate of the
castle of Gaesbeck, the residence of Marquis Arconati,
and something was given to each. The next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
year the applications were renewed: the sum given
to each applicant was fixed at 1<i>d.</i>, and a single day in
the week was fixed for its distribution. On the first
of these days there were 50 applicants; the second,
60. The sum given was reduced to ½<i>d.</i> to a man,
and a farthing to a child; but towards the end of
the season the weekly assemblage had risen to 300
and 400 persons; they came from 10 and 12 miles
distance, and it became necessary to abolish the
allowance, trifling as the amount appears.</p>

<h4><i>Poor Colonies.</i></h4>

<p>The last portion of the Belgian institutions requiring
notice are the poor colonies. We have already
stated, that in 1823 the Belgian Société de Bienfaisance
was established on the model and for the
purposes of that already existing in Holland. In
the beginning of that year the society purchased
522 bonniers (rather less than 1,300 statute acres),
at Wortel, for the establishment of two colonies,
called free, and divided them into 125 farms, of 3½
bonniers (about 9 statute acres) each; 70 in the
colony No. 1, and 55 in the colony No. 2. In
1823 they purchased 516 bonniers (about 1,280
acres), at Mexplus and Ryckevoorsel, for the establishment
of a mendicity colony. The first estate
cost 623<i>l.</i>, the second 554<i>l.</i>, or less than 10<i>s.</i> an
acre, from which the quality of the land may be
inferred.</p>

<p>Families placed in the free colonies were provided
each with a house, barn, and stable, a couple of
cows, sometimes sheep, furniture, clothes, and other
stock, of the estimated value, including the land,
of 1,600 florins (133<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> sterling), which was
charged against them as a debt to the society.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
They were bound to work at wages fixed by the
society, to wear the uniform, and conform to the
rules of the colony, and not to quit its precincts
without leave. A portion of their wages was retained
to repay the original advance made by the
society; a further portion to pay for the necessaries
furnished to them from time to time, and the
food for their cattle; and a portion paid to them in
a base money of the colony, to be expended in
shops established by the society within its limits.</p>

<p>At first each family of colonists worked on its
own farm, and managed its own cattle, but it was
found that the land was uncultivated, and the cattle
died for want of attention or food; and in 1828 the
society took back the cattle, and employed all the
colonists indiscriminately in the general cultivation
of the land of the colony. “From this time,” says
M. Ducpétiaux (p. 624), “the situation of the
colonist who is called free, but is in fact bound to
the society by restrictions which take from him
almost the whole of his liberty for the present,
and deprive him of all hope of future enfranchisement,
has resembled that of the serfs of the middle
ages or of Russia. It is worse than that of the
Irish cottiers, who, if they are fed like him on potatoes
and coarse bread, have at least freedom of
action and the power of changing their residence.”</p>

<p>Those colonists who had obtained a gold or silver
medal, as a testimony that they could support
themselves out of the produce of their own farms,
were excepted from this arrangement, and allowed
to retain the management of their farms, paying a
rent to the society; but at the date of M. Ducpétiaux’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
communication (10th December, 1832), the
greater part even of them had been forced to renounce
this advantage, and to fall back into the
situation of ordinary colonists. Four families were
all that then remained in this state of comparative
emancipation.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the mendicity colony were
from the first subjected to the regulations ultimately
imposed on the free colonists, with the additional
restriction of being required to live in common on
rations afforded by the society; the only respect in
which, according to M. Ducpétiaux, they now differ
from the free colonists.</p>

<p>Count Arrivabene visited these colonies in 1829,
and then predicted their failure. The three years
which elapsed between his visit and the report of
M. Ducpétiaux were sufficient to prove the accuracy
of this prophecy.</p>

<p>It appears from the statement of M. Ducpétiaux
(p. 621), that on the 1st of July, 1832, the debts due
from the society amounted to 776,021 florins (about
64,661<i>l.</i> sterling); the whole value of its property
to 536,250 florins (about 44,698<i>l.</i> sterling); leaving
a deficit of 239,771 florins, or nearly 20,000<i>l.</i>
sterling. And this deficit was likely to increase
every year; the expenses, as they had done from
the beginning, greatly exceeding the receipts, a
fact which is shown by the following table:&mdash;</p>

<p>M. Ducpétiaux’s statement may be compared
with that of Captain Brandreth, who visited the
colonies at about the same period. (pp. 19, 20.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Among the colonists there were a few whose previous habits
and natural dispositions disposed them to avail themselves, to the
best of their ability, of the benevolent provisions thus offered for
their relief, and who had worked industriously, and conducted
themselves well during their residence in the colony. Their land
was cultivated to the extent of their means; and their dwelling-houses
had assumed an appearance of greater comfort, order,
and civilization than the rest. But these were too few in number,
and the result too trifling to offer the stimulus of emulation to
others.</p>

<p>Those farms that I examined, with the above exceptions, were
not encouraging examples: there were few evidences of thrift and
providence, the interior of the dwellings being, in point of comfort,
little, if at all removed from the humblest cottage of the most
straitened condition of labourers in this country.</p>

<p>A clause in the regulations allows certain of the colonists,
whose good conduct and industry have obtained them the privilege,
to barter with the neighbouring towns for any article they
may want.</p>

<p>The nearest towns to the establishment, of any note, are
Hoogstraten and Tournhout; but on inquiry I could not find
that any intercourse was maintained with them; and the country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
round offered no evidences of the existence of a thriving community
in its centre, exercising an influence on its traffic or occupations.
In the winter I should think the roads to the colonies
scarcely practicable for any description of carriages.</p>

<p>From what I saw of the social condition of the colonists, I am
disposed to insist much on the inexpediency of assembling, in an
isolated position especially, a large community of paupers for this
experiment.</p>

<p>Admitting the physical difficulties to have been much less than
they are, and the prospect of pecuniary advantage much greater
and more certain, the moral objections to the system would
outweigh them. Without the example of the better conditions of
society, there can be no hope of such a community gradually acquiring
those qualities that would fit the members of it for a better
condition. One or two families established in the neighbourhood
of an orderly and industrious community would find the stimulus
of shame, as well as emulation, acting on their moral qualities and
exertions; but in the present case, where all are in a condition of
equal debasement, both of those powerful stimuli are wanting.
The reports of the progress of the Dutch free colonies up to the
year 1828 are certainly encouraging; and as the same system
has been adopted in the free colonies of Belgium as in Holland,
and the experiment in both cases tried on similar soils, they might
lead to the inference that some peculiar cause has operated in favour
of the Dutch colonies, and against those of Belgium. Not
having had an opportunity of visiting the Dutch colonies, I cannot
offer an opinion on the subject; but reasoning from what I
personally witnessed, I should be disposed to think, that either
some greater encouragement has been granted in Holland, or
some improvement of the system adopted; or that the habits,
dispositions, and character of the Dutch fit them better for this
experiment.</p>

<p>The same authorities that I have quoted in the case of these
colonies, speak favourably also of the Belgian colonies up to the
same period; and on the part of the latter experiment it may be
asserted, that the unsettled state of the country since that period
ought very much to qualify any condemnation of its principle.
But notwithstanding this disadvantage (which is much less, I fear,
than has been insisted on), there would still have remained evidences
of the probable success of the experiment. Those evidences
were not satisfactory to my mind; and I may further observe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
that while the people in general recommended the colonies to
foreigners as especially worthy of their notice, I do not remember
meeting with one individual who could point out any specific results,
and few who would distinctly assert that there was any
increasing and permanent benefit to the community from them.</p>

<p>It is probable that unless some great change is made in the
present system, the colonies will be ultimately abandoned, or
merge into the establishments for compulsory labour: in other
words, the society will become the farmers, and the present colonists
merely agricultural labourers, differing only from the ordinary
labourer, inasmuch as they will work under the penalty of
being treated as vagabonds in case of contumacy.</p>

<p>The observations I have hitherto made apply only to the free
colonies. In the mendicity or compulsory colonies, the poor are
assembled in large establishments, and cultivate the ground, either
by task or day labour, and attend the cattle, &amp;c., under the direction
of certain officers; it is, in fact, a species of agricultural
workhouse.</p>

Merxplas. (p. 20.)</p>

<p>The number of deaths is very striking. It
amounts to 502 in six years, or 83⅔ per year, the
average population during that time having consisted
of 708 persons; so that the average annual
mortality was nearly 12 per cent. The proportion
of desertions appears also to have progressively increased,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
until in the last year 66 deserted out of

<h3>FRANCE.</h3>

<p>The information contained in this Appendix
respecting the poor-laws of France, and their
administration, consists of a paper by M. Frederic de
Chateauvieux, on the comparative state of the poor
in France and England (p. 21); a report by Mr.
Majendie, from Normandy (p. 34); and reports by
his Majesty’s Consuls from Havre (p. 179), Brest
(p. 724), Nantes (p. 171), Bourdeaux (p. 229),
Bayonne (p. 260), and Marseilles (p. 185).</p>

<p>We have already stated (pp. 117-125) the general
outline of the French establishments for the
relief of the poor, consisting of hospices for the impotent,
hospitals for the sick, depôts de mendicité
for vagrants and beggars (constituting the in-doors
relief), and bureaux de bienfaisance for the secours à
domicile, or out-doors relief. But this comprehensive
and discriminative system of public relief appears
to have been carried into effect in France
with a far less approach to completeness than in
Belgium. The number of hospices and hospitals is
indeed large in the towns, and not inconsiderable in
the country: but of the depôts de mendicité, of
which the decree of 1808 ordered the establishment,
very few were in fact organized, and of those
the greater part have since been suppressed; and
the bureaux de bienfaisance are almost confined to
the towns. As more than three-fourths of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
population of France is agricultural, only a small
portion of that population therefore is capable of
participating in public or organized relief. M. de
Chateauvieux estimates that portion, or, in other
words, the population of the towns possessing institutions
for the relief of the poor, at 3,500,000
persons, and the value of the public relief annually
afforded at 1,800,000<i>l.</i> sterling. (p 25.) If this
approximation can be relied on, the expenditure
per head in that portion of the French population
nearly equals the expenditure per head in England.</p>

<p>The following are the most material portions of
the consular reports:&mdash;</p>

<p>The provisions for the relief of the poor in Havre
may be collected from the following statement of
the principal regulations of the hospitals, the bureau
de bienfaisance, and the depôt de mendicité for the
department, which is situated in Rouen. (pp. 182,

<h5><i>Hospital Regulations at Havre.</i></h5>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Hospital.</span></div>

<p>Aged persons of 60, without distinction of sex, are admitted
into the hospital upon a certificate of indigence delivered by the
mayor of their district, and a ticket of admission signed by one of
the directors of the establishment.</p>

<p>The sick are admitted if they can produce a certificate of indigence
from the mayor or curate of their parish, and every care
is taken of them at the expense of the establishment.</p>

<p>Orphans, foundlings, or deserted children are admitted, provided
they are under 12 years; they are then engaged as servants
or apprentices; but should they get out of employment from no
fault of their own, they are at liberty to return until the age of 21
years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Regulations of the Establishment of the Bureau de Bienfaisance,
of Havre.</i></h5>

<div class="sidenote">Bureau
de Bienfaisance.</div>

<p>1. None are admitted but those whose poverty is well known,
and who have lived 12 months in the town. The number of persons
to be relieved is fixed by the bureau, whose names must be
entered in a register, stating their age, date of application, place
of residence, number and age of their children.</p>

<p>2. There is a second register for such poor who, having resided
one year in Havre, shall apply after the closing of the register
mentioned in the above article. This inscription is made in
order of their dates, and the paupers carried upon it will only be
entitled to relief in turn, and as vacancies occur in the first list,
by departures, deaths, or discharge.</p>

<p>3. No poor of either sex can receive relief if more than 15 years
old, and under 50. This exclusion is not applicable to widows
with young children, or with four children under 15 years. In
all cases they must produce a certificate that their children attend
the free school, and are diligent.</p>

<p>4. The inscription in the register mentioned in No. 2, can only
take place after inquiry has been made respecting the claimant,
and it has been authorized by the bureau, which meets for this
purpose once a month.</p>

<p>5. No children can be admitted to the assistance of the bureau,
nor into the classes of instruction and work, above the age of 15,
or without having been vaccinated.</p>

<p>6. If the number of children attending the classes and work
shall be too many, either on account of the size of the building
or the attention of the instructors, preference will be given to the
children whose parents are already on their lists, and who are
known to require assistance for the education of their children.</p>

<p>7. Every year, at the period of the first communion, a certain
number of children shall be clothed. But to be admitted to this
assistance they must produce a certificate from the clergyman
appointed to give religious instruction, or from the nuns of the
convent, that they have been attentive and are deserving. The
boys are clothed in brown cloth; the girls in coloured calico.</p>

<p>8. Every year the sum of 653 fr. (26<i>l.</i>) shall be given to the
clergymen of the town, in tickets of 1 fr. (9<i>d.</i>), 50 c. (4½<i>d.</i>), to be
distributed where they think proper, of which only those who are
past 60 or under 15 can participate.</p>

<p>9. Each person shall receive 3 lbs. of bread, two in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
family 6 lbs. of ditto, three to five persons in the same family,
whose children are under 15, 12 lbs. of ditto, for 15 days. The
number admitted to this relief to be regulated each year, so that
the distribution shall not exceed 3,000 lbs. a month. These distributions
will take place to the most needy each Monday and
Friday, from 9 to 12 o’clock, after which no more will be given.</p>

<p>10. In the distribution of clothing, which will be made once a
year, each individual will only be clothed once in two years.</p>

<p>11. When the establishment is enabled to give woollen clothing,
it will only be to such as are above 60 years, or to children under
seven years, and those the most destitute; this relief once in two
years.</p>

<p>12. If any one who receives bread and clothing from the bureau
sells or pawns the same, he shall be struck off.</p>

<p>13. All clothes given by the establishment shall be marked, so
that they may be known.</p>

<p>14. Assistance to lying-in women, new-born children, and sick,
will be rendered at their houses; those who are not on the lists
cannot be assisted until their case is examined; money will not
be given to women in labour but when absolutely necessary; soup
is distributed on Mondays and Wednesdays, from two to three
o’clock.</p>

<p>15. There is attached to the establishment a doctor, at 400 fr.
(16<i>l.</i>), and two assistants, at 500 fr. (20<i>l.</i>) each per year, who
attend such as are named by the bureau; and also women in extraordinary
cases of labour.</p>

<p>16. A midwife is attached, at 200 fr. (8<i>l.</i>) a year, who attends
all women designated by the bureau.</p>

<p>17. In hard weather, if it should be thought expedient to make
a subscription, the poor who are upon the second list (article 2)
will be relieved from it.</p>

pain of dismissal, to allow the inmates to send any message or
commission, or have any correspondence whatever beyond the
walls of the establishment. Letters to and from them must be
laid before the governor before they are forwarded.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Section 2.</span>&mdash;<i>In-doors Porter.</i></h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 3.</span> To prevent all communication between the mendicants
of different sexes and ages, the porter is ordered to keep locked
the doors of the dormitories, the work-shops, the courts for recreation,
and other places to which the inmates have access, as
soon as they have quitted them, in pursuance of the regulations
of the place.</p>

<p>4. It is the duty of the porter and other officers and servants
to see that the inmates are carefully kept to the apartments provided
for them respectively. The porter must go the rounds
from time to time to ascertain this.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Section 3.</span>&mdash;<i>Dormitories.</i></h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 1.</span> The bell is to announce the hour of rising from the
1st of March to the 30th of September at 4 o’clock in the morning,
and from the 1st Oct. to the 28th Feb. at 6. The inspectors
must take care that the inmates immediately rise.</p>

<p>3. After prayers at 6 o’clock in summer, and 7 in winter, the
inmates, accompanied by the inspectors, are to proceed to their
respective workshops. The dormitories are to be swept and
cleaned by two inmates, selected by turns for this employment
out of each dormitory, and then to be kept locked.</p>

<p>4. At 9 in the evening, in all seasons, the bell is to announce
bedtime. The inmates are immediately to proceed to their
respective dormitories; the roll is to be called by the inspector,
and prayers (not lasting more than a quarter of an hour) are to
be said, and listened to attentively; after prayers each shall go
quietly to bed, and perfect silence be kept in every dormitory.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Refectories.</i></h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 1.</span> Breakfast shall take place during the summer six
months precisely at 8 in the morning, and during the six winter
months at 9, and last half an hour. Immediately after breakfast the
inmates are to return to work until precisely half-past 12 o’clock,
the dinner hour at all seasons.</p>

<p>5. From half-past 12 till 2 is allowed for dinner and for recreation,
under the inspection, in each division, of a servant. At
2 o’clock precisely the bell is to summon the inmates to return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
work, and the inspectors are to call the roll in each workshop.</p>

<p>6. At 8 in the evening, in all seasons, the bell is to be rung for
supper; the inmates may remain in the refectory till nine.</p>

<p>7. The same regulations shall be observed in the dormitories
and refectories of each sex, except that as respects the aged, sick,
and infirm.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Section 4.</span>&mdash;<i>Workshops.</i></h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 1.</span> The inspectors are to see that every workman is busily
employed, and loses no time.</p>

<p>2. The workshops are to be kept locked during the hours of
work, and the inmates not allowed to leave them.</p>

<p>3. Each able-bodied inmate is to have a task set him, proportioned
to his strength and skill. If he do not finish it, he is to be
paid only for what he has done, put on dry bread, and kept to
work during the hours of recreation.</p>

<p>4. Every workman, who for three consecutive days fails in
completing his task, is to be kept during the hours of meals and
of recreation, and during the night, confined in the punishment-room
upon bread and water, until he has accomplished his task.</p>

<p>5. Every workman who wilfully or negligently spoils the materials,
tools, or furniture in his care, shall pay for them out of the
reserved third of his earnings, besides still further punishment as
the case may deserve.</p>

<p>6. Every workman doing more than his task is to be paid two-thirds
of the value of his extra labour.</p>

<p>7. With respect to every inmate who shall have been imprisoned,
5 centimes for each day of imprisonment shall be deducted
from the reserved third of his earnings. The amount of these
deductions, and of all fines and other casual sources of profit, is to
form a reserved fund for the purpose of rewards for those inmates
who may distinguish themselves among their companions by good
conduct and industry.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Section 7.</span>&mdash;<i>Religious Instruction.</i></h6>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. 1.</span> Religious and moral instruction is to be given in the
chapel twice a week&mdash;on Sundays and Thursdays, at 7 in the
evening.</p>

<p>All the able-bodied inmates are to be present, in silence and
attention, under the inspection of their respective superintendents.

<p>7. When any of these regulations are broken, the inspectors
and other officers are to report to the Governor, and he is to
pronounce sentence on the inmates.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Britany.</span></h4>

<p>Mr. Perrier’s report from Brest, and Mr. Newman’s
from Nantes, give a very interesting account
of the state of Britany. We will begin by Mr.
Perrier’s, as the more general view. (pp. 728, 729.)</p>

<p>It is extremely difficult to obtain any statistical information in
Britany, all inquiries being received with distrust, not only by
the authorities, but also by the inhabitants. This has been the
principal cause of my delay in replying to the series of questions.
The answers, imperfect as they may appear, are the result of
patient and persevering inquiry.</p>

<p>The state of society in Britany, and its institutions, differ so
widely from those of any other civilized country, that few of the
questions are applicable. In order, therefore, to convey the information
which they are intended to elicit, it is necessary to
enter into a description of the population, which I shall endeavour
to do as briefly as possible.</p>

<p>The population of Britany may be classed under the following
heads:</p>

<ul>

<li>Old noblesse, possessing a portion of the land.</li>

<li>Proprietors, retired merchants, and others, who have
vested their money in landed property.</li>

<li>Peasants, owners of the ground they till.</li>

<li>Farmers.</li>

<li>Daily labourers and beggars.</li>

</ul>

<p>The abolition of the right of primogeniture causes a daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
diminution of the two first classes. As property, at the demise
of the owner, must be divided equally amongst his children, who
can seldom agree about the territorial division, it is put up for
sale, purchased by speculators, and resold in small lots to suit
the peasantry. Farmers having amassed sufficient to pay a part,
generally one-half, of the purchase-money of a lot, buy it, giving
a mortgage at five or six per cent. for the remainder. Thus petty
proprietors increase, and large proprietors and farmers decrease.</p>

<p>A man, industrious enough to work all the year, can easily get
a farm.</p>

<p>Farms are small. Their average size in Lower Britany does
not exceed 14 acres. Some are so small as two acres, and there
are many of from four to eight. The largest in the neighbourhood
of Brest is 36 acres. The average rate of rent is 1<i>l.</i> 5<i>s.</i> per
acre for good land, and 8<i>s.</i> for poor land (partly under broom
and furze).</p>

<p>The farmers are very poor, and live miserably: yet, their wants
being few and easily satisfied, they are comparatively happy.
Their food consists of barley bread, butter, buck wheat (made
into puddings, porridge, and cakes). Soup, composed of cabbage-water,
a little grease or butter and salt poured on bread. Potatoes;
meat twice a week (always salt pork).</p>

<p>A family of 12, including servants and children, consumes
annually about 700 lbs. of pork and 100 lbs. of cow beef; the
latter only on festivals.</p>

<p>The class of daily labourers can only be said to exist in towns.
In the country they are almost unknown.</p>

<p>The inmates of each farm, consisting of the farmer’s family,
and one, two, or three males, and as many female servants
(according to the size of the farm), paid annually, and who live
with the family, suffice for the general work. At harvest some
additional hands are employed. These are generally people who
work two or three months in the year, and beg during the remainder.
Daily labourers and beggars may, therefore, in the
country, be classed under the same head.</p>

<p>Farmers’ servants are orphans or children of unfortunate
farmers.</p>

<p>The conditions of the poorer farmers, daily labourers and
beggars, are so near akin, that the passage from one state to
another is very frequent.</p>

<p>Mendicity is not considered disgraceful in Britany. Farmers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
allow their children to beg along the roads. On saints’ days,
especially the festivals of celebrated saints, whose shrines attract
numerous votaries (all of whom give something, be it ever so
little, to the poor), the aged, infirm, and children of poor
farmers and labourers, turn out. Some small hamlets are even
totally abandoned by their inhabitants for two or three days. All
attend the festival, to beg.</p>

<p>The Bretons are hospitable. Charity and hospitality are considered
religious duties. Food and shelter for a night are never
refused.</p>

<p>Several attempts to suppress mendicity have been unsuccessful.
District asylums were established. No sooner were they filled
than the vacancies in the beggar stands were immediately replenished
by fresh subjects from the country; it being a general
feeling that it is much easier and more comfortable to live by
alms than by labour.</p>

<p>In towns where the police is well regulated, the only mendicants
permitted to sojourn are paupers belonging to the parish.
They are known by a tin badge, for which they pay at the police
office.</p>

<p>No such thing is known as a legal claim for assistance from
public or private charities.</p>

<p>In towns, destitute workmen or other persons in distress must
be authorized by the municipality previous to soliciting public or
private assistance. To this effect, the pauper makes known his
case to the commissary of police of the quarter he inhabits, who
makes inquiry among the neighbours. Should the destitute case
of the applicant be established, the mayor grants him a certificate
of indigence, which authorizes him to apply for relief to the
public institutions, and to solicit private charity. It also exempts
him (or rather causes his exemption) from the payment of taxes.</p>

<p>The principal cause of misery is inebriety; its frequency among
the lower orders keeps them in poverty. The “<i>cabaret</i>” (wine
and brandy shop) absorbs a great portion of their earnings.
This vice is not confined to men; the women partake of it. It
has decreased within the last five or six years, but is still considerable.</p>

</div>

<p>We now proceed to give some extracts from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
more detailed report of Mr. Newman, who writes,
it must be recollected, from Nantes. (pp. 171, 172,

<h6><i>Vagrants.</i></h6>

<p>In the department Loire Inférieure there is no asylum for
mendicants; but Nantes has a species of workhouse, “St. Joseph’s
House,” supported entirely by private subscriptions. To this
house the tribunals often send vagabonds, in virtue of the 274th
article of the Penal Code, although the directors of the establishment
have contested, and still contest, the right assumed by the
judges to do so; and they never receive any person so sent as a
criminal to be detained a certain number of days at labour as if
in a prison, but merely give him a refuge as an act of charity,
and liberty to leave the place, if he likes to go before the time
expires. The number of vagrants that formerly infested Nantes
(strangers to the department as well as to the city) have decreased
to about a tenth part since begging in the streets was
prohibited, and the paupers sent to this establishment.</p>

<p>The hospitals of Nantes receive all workmen, travellers, and
needy strangers, that fall sick in the city (if foreigners, at the
charge to their consuls of 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> sterling per day for men, and
10<i>d.</i> for women.) If a man, (and his family also,) being destitute,
wishes to return to his native place, and has not rendered
himself liable to be committed as a vagrant, the préfet has the
power to give a passport to him for that place; on the production
of which at the mairie of the commune from which he sets
out he receives from the public funds of the department three
halfpence per league for the distance from thence to the next
place he is to be relieved at, and so on to the end of his journey,
each place he has to stop at being set down on his passport; if
he deviates from the route designated, he is arrested as a vagabond.</p>

<p>There is in France throughout the whole country a general
union for each of several trades, the carpenters, bakers, masons,
tailors, &amp;c. In each city or town of consequence, each society
has a member who is called “the mother,” who receives the
weekly contributions of those who reside in that place, affords
relief to all of its members passing through it, and is obliged to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
procure work for the applicant, or support him at a fixed rate,
established by their bye-laws, until a situation be provided for him
there or elsewhere. Those unions sometimes assume a very
dangerous power, by compelling masters to hire all their members
that are without work, before they engage one man who does not
belong to them.</p>

<h6><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h6>

<p>In times of political commotion, of unforeseen events, of rigorous
seasons, when the usual courses of labour are stopped,
the civil administrations create temporary workshops, furnish
tools, &amp;c., to the labourers, and enter into contracts for repairs to
the streets, quays, bridges, roads, &amp;c., from which a large city,
as well as the country parishes, can always draw some advantages
for the money so distributed, to employ those persons who
would otherwise be supported without work by the same funds.
The money required on those occasions is furnished by the
treasury of the city or commune, assisted by private subscriptions
from nearly all persons in easy circumstances. The want of
regular or parish workhouses for labourers, unemployed, is in
some measure supplied by private charities, for a great number of
wealthy families, and others of the middling class, give employment
to old men, women, and children, in spinning, and in
weaving of coarse linen, at prices far beyond those that the
articles can be purchased at in the shops; but this plan is adopted
to prevent a disposition to idleness, although at a greater sacrifice,
perhaps, than would be made by most of the promoters of it,
in a public subscription.</p>

<p>The bureau de bienfaisance distributes annually about 80,000 fr.;
the chief part, or very nearly the whole, to poor families at their
homes, in clothes, food, fuel, and sometimes money; but of the
latter as little as possible. Les dames de charité (ladies of the
first families, who are appointed annually to visit and give relief
to the poor, each having a fixed district) distribute about three-fourths
of that sum, which would be insufficient for the indigent
if it were not assisted by distributions made by the priests of the
different parishes and other persons employed to do so by private
families, who give their alms in that manner, and not at their own
residences. It is generally supposed that, in the whole, not less
than 250,000 fr. are so distributed annually in the city of Nantes.
In making this distribution care is always taken to prefer invalids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
to those in health.</p>

<h6><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h6>

<p>In the city of Nantes there is a general hospital, called the
“Sanitat,” for the reception of the old and impotent; at present it
contains about 800; it answers to an English workhouse; the
inmates are lodged, fed, clothed, and are taken care of in every
way: they are employed about trifling work, but the average gain
by it does not exceed 20 fr. per annum for each. The average
cost appears to be about 11 to 12 sous per day for each person.
The establishment of St. Joseph’s, already alluded to, is, in fact,
a sort of assistant to the Sanitat (although supported by private
charity) for the 100 to 120 old people it contains. The Sanitat
has a ward for dangerous as well as ordinary lunatics; is under
the same board and direction as the Hôtel Dieu (the general
hospital for the sick); but each is supported by its own funds,
arising from bequests and donations from private persons, and
from the city funds; yet if either hospital should require any
assistance, the money wanted would be voted by the city treasury.</p>

<p>The general council for the department votes about 1200 to
1250 fr. annually to the Sanitat from the departmental funds.</p>

<h6><i>Sick.</i></h6>

<p>Nantes has a general hospital (Hôtel Dieu) for the sick, containing
600 beds, 300 of which are reserved for the indigent of
the city. The expense of this establishment is about a franc to
25 sous per day to each person. The military are received at
20 sous per man per day, which is paid by the government. It
is supported by its own funds, arising from bequests and donations,
and grants made from time to time by the city; is under
the same board and direction as the Sanitat. If a poor person
becomes sick in the country, he is either relieved by the curé of
the parish or by some of the more wealthy neighbours, or he
comes into Nantes and resides there for a week or ten days before
he makes an application to the mayor to be admitted into the
hospital; he is then sent there as an inhabitant of the city. The
authorities in the country have not the right to send a patient to
the Hôtel Dieu, yet a great number arrive at the hospital, sent
by country practitioners, who have not the skill, or perhaps the
leisure or inclination, to attend to them; and <i>they are always
received</i>, if it be possible to take them in. The students at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
hospital are ever ready to admit any difficult cases or fractures
from the country, for their own improvement.</p>

<p>There are also hospitals for the sick at the following places in
the Loire Inférieure: Ancenis, for the town and commune; Chateaubriand,
Paimbœuf, Savenay, and Clisson, for the towns only.</p>

<p>Besides the succour afforded to the poor at their homes by the
bureau de bienfaisance, there are three dispensaries supported by
that establishment, for administering relief to the sick, who are
attended at their homes, if necessary, by the nuns of St. Vincent
de Paule, 12 or 14 of whom are kept in the pay of, and are
wholly supported by the bureau. They carry to them soup and
other victuals, remedies, &amp;c., and lend them linen and clothes, if
wanted. There are a number of young men, who are either
studying, or have just completed their study of medicine, who are
anxious to give their assistance gratis, and who are in constant
attendance on those who are receiving relief from the dispensaries.
It is impossible to state the extent to which such relief is given.
The nuns are paid by the bureau de bienfaisance, which also pays
for the medicines, &amp;c. they distribute; but the sum that is thus
expended bears but a small proportion to the amount that is distributed
by the hands of those sisters, who, from the accurate
knowledge they possess of the real situation and condition of
each person they visit, are employed by numerous wealthy persons
to distribute privately such charities as they feel disposed to give;
and can thus be well applied in providing those little comforts for
the invalids, which cannot be sent from the bureau to all those who
require them, although the funds are increased from time to time
by the proceeds of representations at the theatre, public concerts,
&amp;c. given for that purpose.</p>

<p>Independent of the foregoing, there are several tradesmen’s
societies on the plan of benefit societies in England, the members
of which pay five or six sous per week, and receive, in case of
sickness, all necessary assistance in medicines, &amp;c., besides an
indemnity of a franc to a franc and a half per day during the
time they are unable to work.</p>

<h6><i>Orphans, Foundlings, or Deserted Children.</i></h6>

<p>The law requires an establishment (a tour) in each department,
for the secret reception of children. Every arrival is particularly
noted and described in a register kept for that purpose,
that the infant may be recognised if it should be claimed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
children, after having received all necessary assistance and baptism,
are confided to women in the country (a regulation of this
department only), to dry-nurse them (au biberon); they are paid
eight francs per month for the first year, seven for the second
and third, six until the ninth year, and four francs per month
from that time until the child is 12 years old; when the nurse
who has taken care of one from its birth to that age receives a
present of 50 fr. for her attention. A basket of requisite linen is
given with the child, and a new suit of clothes annually for seven
years. These regulations are observed for orphans and foundlings.
The registers for the last 20 years give an average of
360 to 370 admissions annually; <i>more than one-half of them
die under one year old</i>; therefore, with the deaths at other ages,
and the claims that are made for some of them before they attain
12 years, the establishment has seldom at its charge more than
from 1200 to 1300, of all ages, from 0 to 12.</p>

<p>The parents being unknown when they place their infants in
the “tour,” cannot be traced afterwards, unless they acknowledge
themselves; they are, however, as has been observed before,
liable for the expenses of their offspring; and whenever they are
discovered, whether by claiming their children or otherwise, the
right to make them repay the costs they have occasioned is always
maintained, and they are compelled to pay the whole, or as much
as their finances will admit of.</p>

<p>Deserted children of the city, or the children of poor persons,
who cannot support them, are received and treated in a similar
manner, without being placed in the “tour;” they are admitted
according to the state of the finances appropriated to such branch
of the establishment, which in general permits from 80 to 100 to
be on it. Certificates are required that the parents are dead, the
child abandoned, or that the mother is totally unable to support
it, or that she has a number of young children. Independent of
the 1400 children thus received by the Hôtel Dieu, the bureau de
bienfaisance supports 200 <i>legitimate</i> children, and the société
maternelle from 60 to 80, until they attain the age of 18 years.</p>

<p>The number of deaths in 1832 was 11,999; the number under
one year old, 1970, or one in 6¹²⁄₁₉₇. Chateauneuf states, <i>for all
France</i>, 33 deaths, under one year old, out of every hundred
births, which is nearly double the number of deaths of that description
for this department; but the mortality is much greater
amongst the orphans, foundlings, and deserted children of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
city received at the hospital. An account, made up to the year
1828, gave an average of 52 deaths, under one year old, of every
hundred children received there; and since that date it has increased
considerably.</p>

<p>There are women in the city who make it their business to
place infants in the “tour,” and who afterwards attend the delivery
of them to the country nurses, and thus, knowing where
certain children are placed, give notice to the parents, who can
visit them without being discovered. Children thus recognised
are frequently demanded by their parents for servants, in the
ordinary way; and by this plan they screen themselves from the
payment of the child’s support.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of
these institutions.</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that the prospect of an asylum for the
indigent creates amongst the working class a disposition to idleness
and debauchery, whilst at the same time there are those who
look down with disgust on their miserable brothers who are compelled
to accept a public charitable support; and the shame
which they consider attaches to a man who does it stimulates
them to avoid the doors of an hospital by industry and sobriety.
The number of these, however, is very small, whilst the applications
for admittance to the Sanitat and to St. Joseph’s are so
very numerous, so far beyond the accommodation that can be
granted, that after the name of an applicant is registered he has
(frequently) to wait 18 to 24 months for his turn. For the
sick, however, at the Hôtel Dieu it is not so; for arrangements
are made that no delay takes place with any case requiring immediate
relief or treatment.</p>

<p>The shades between the healthy labourers of the lowest class
that support themselves, and those who obtain relief from charitable
institutions, are so slight, that it is almost impossible to
state the difference in their conditions. <i>No man</i> has a <i>legal claim</i>
upon any of the charities; in the distribution of which, however,
there is but one fixed rule that governs the distributors, and that
is, to compel the applicants for relief to work to their utmost
power, and to give such relief only in each individual case as
they suppose to be necessary with the wages he can or ought to
earn, according to the demand for labourers at the time.</p>

<p>According to the price of lodgings, victuals and clothing in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Nantes, a steady labourer at the highest rate of wages, 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>
per day, supposing he had 300 days’ employment in the year, is
considered to be able to support a wife and three young children;
if he has a larger family, is out of employ, or is at a lower rate
of wages, without his wife and children being able to gain a little,
he is regarded as indigent, and in need of succour. A labourer,
his wife, and three children consume in the day from 8 to 10 lbs.
of bread, which is their chief food, and will cost him 240 fr.; his
cabbages and other vegetables, butter or fat for his soup, 90 fr.;
his room, 50 fr.; leaving 70 fr. or 2<i>l.</i> 18<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for clothes, fuel,
&amp;c.; which make up the sum of his wages for 300 days at 1½ fr.,
or 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> per day. The wife in general adds a little to the husband’s
earnings by spinning, and sometimes weaving; but it is
not much when the family is young.</p>

<p>To prevent the increase and lessen the present state of disorder
into which the greater part of the labouring class and mechanics
of Nantes has fallen, a number of master tradesmen and proprietors
of factories will not employ those men who do not agree to
allow a certain sum weekly to be retained from their wages for
the use of the wife and family. The example spreads, and will
no doubt become more general; but this circumstance shows
forth, in strong colours, the immoral state of the working class in
France.</p>

<p>There are no cottages for labourers, as are seen in England:
the chief part of the work on farms in this part of France is done
by servants in the house of the farmer, or by married labourers, to
whom an acre or two, sometimes as high as 10, according to the
quality, is fenced off from the estate for the use of the man and
his family; for which he has to give a certain number of days’
work. If such patch of land requires to be ploughed, the farmer
does it for him, for an additional number of days’ work. Besides
those, there are an immense number of little proprietors, having
from an acre and a half to 10 or 15 acres; and they give their
labour also to the farmers of larger estates, receiving in return
either assistance with oxen, carts, ploughs, &amp;c., or an equivalent
in some produce which they do not raise on their own land. Very
little money, if any, passes between them. These little properties
have sprung up from labourers and others fencing in small patches
of commons or waste lands. Nearly all the vineyards in the
Loire Inférieure are cultivated by labourers, who have a small
spot of ground partitioned off from the main estate: it is for
married men only that ground is so divided; the single men live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
with their families in the villages, or in public-houses, but generally
in the latter. In regard to these questions, it must be observed
that almost every farmer who hires an estate takes such a one as
will just sustain his family, without the aid, or with the assistance
only of a man or a man and woman servants, and that therefore
very few daily labourers find employment. Few estates run to
200 acres, and if so large, a daily labourer is only hired during
harvest, so wretchedly is the husbandry of the country managed.</p>

<p>The cottages or houses in villages for labourers are in general
the property of the owners of the large estates in the neighbourhood,
as well as those that are built on the patches of land for
the use of those who are married; some of the latter, however,
are built at the joint expense of the farmer and labourer. A cottage
or cottages in a detached place from a village, or a house in
such a situation, with a little plot of ground for a garden for each
apartment, lets for about 20 to 30 francs a year per room, whether
the building consists of one or of four rooms. In the villages
the rent is a little higher, from 30 to 50, and sometimes as high
as 80, if the garden be large to a cottage with only one room.
These buildings are so seldom on sale, that the price cannot be
stated with accuracy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>There are no houses of industry in this department for the
destitute able-bodied, except that known as the <i>Depôt de Mendicité</i>.</p>

<p>This institution was first established in the year 1827, with a
view to suppress the great number of professed beggars who
infested the streets and public walks, taking advantage of any
defect of conformation, &amp;c. to attract the notice of passengers.
By law all persons found begging in the streets are liable to be
taken up, and imprisoned; but instead of imprisonment, those
arrested are conveyed to the <i>Depôt de Mendicité</i>, where, if able,
they are made to work. The good effects of this institution are
visible; for instead of the number of professed beggars amounting
to 800, which it did before the institution of the establishment,
it does not now amount to above 150 or 200.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>This institution is supported by private contribution. The
King and the town contribute a certain portion to make up what
may be wanting. The average number of the population of the
depôt amounts to 350 souls.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, owing to the want of population, employment
is to be found in commerce, trade or agriculture. The high
price of wages in the towns and in the country proves that work
is always to be found.</p>

<p>When any unforeseen circumstances have arisen to interrupt
the common order of things, the local authorities have come to
the assistance of the population, by giving work to those out of
employment. Public subscriptions are also resorted to on these
occasions.</p>

<p>All indigent families, and in which there are those capable of
working, but who are not able to obtain it, or whose numbers
are so great that all cannot be subsisted, are relieved by the <i>Bureaux
de Charité</i>.</p>

<p>The same relief is given to those who, having a habitation, are
unable of themselves, through age or infirmity, to support themselves.</p>

<p>The mode of obtaining this relief is by petition, signed by some
credible person, and attested by the priest or protestant clergyman.
It is proportioned to the number of the family, and to the
number of those able to work, and whose wages go to the maintenance
of the family. The relief consists in bread, soup, wood
for fuel, and sometimes, though rarely, blankets and woollen
clothing; medicines for the sick, and broth.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, these distributions of food would be insufficient;
but most indigent families are assisted by private persons,
so that, on the whole, they have wherewithal to sustain life.</p>

<p>The annual <i>distribution à domicile</i> (domiciliary relief) amounts
to the sum of 100,000 francs (4,000<i>l.</i>).</p>

<p>3,520 families are relieved. The number of impotent in these
families, father and mother included, though able to work, amounts
to 9,634, or less than a franc per head per month.</p>

<p>It is in proportion to these numbers that the relief is given, but
it is greater in winter than the other parts of the year.</p>

<p>As to the medicines and broth, whenever there are sick in these
families a sufficiency is given. Physicians are attached to each
auxiliary bureau of every district, who visit the sick, prescribe the
remedies, &amp;c., all of which are distributed by the <i>Sœurs de Charité</i>
(Sisters of Charity, an order of nuns who devote themselves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the care of the poor and sick, and who undertake, gratuitously,
the elementary education of their children). It is a most respectable
and praiseworthy institution.</p>

<p>The same Sisters receive in their houses the little girls of these
families who are old enough to read. Books are supplied by the
instructors.</p>

<p>In extraordinary cases, recourse is had to subscriptions and
collections, which increase the means of the <i>Bureaux de Charité</i>;
so that during long and hard winters, more clothing, &amp;c. is distributed.
It seldom happens that money is given.</p>

<p>There are, however, no positive regulations on these points.
The whole is in the hands of the directors of this establishment.
A responsible receiver is attached to it, whose accounts are submitted
to the examination of the <i>Cours des Comptes</i> (audit office).
Thus, though the distributions are left to the judgment of the
directors, they are subjected to control.</p>

<p>The above details relate to the city of Bourdeaux. There are,
however, proportionate institutions in most of the larger towns of
the department, but in the poorer parishes and rural districts the
<i>Bureaux de Charité</i> are merely nominal. These parishes being
without a revenue, are unable to assist their poor, who subsist on
the alms they may receive at the different dwelling-houses, and
who when ill, if possible, come to the nearest hospital, generally
to that of Bourdeaux.</p>

<p>In this department there are no schools in which indigent children
are received to be fed and clothed gratuitously, but there are
those in which they receive a certain degree of instruction.</p>

<p>For Boys.&mdash;The institution of <i>Freres des Ecoles Chrétiennes</i>
(Brothers of the Christian Schools), and two Lancasterian schools,
which have been lately instituted.</p>

<p>For Girls.&mdash;A Lancasterian school, a few boarding schools, in
which a certain number of indigent girls are taught gratuitously;
and also the Sisters of Charity attached to the administration of
the <i>Bureaux de Charité</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Ecoles Chrétiennes</i> are at the charge of the town. The
sum appropriated to those establishments amounts annually to
about 14,000 francs (560<i>l.</i>). Admissions are granted by the
town. The number of children instructed in reading, writing,
and a little arithmetic, amounts to about 1,800 for the town. At
the Lancasterian school, the instruction is on a more extended
scale. Grammar, drawing and surveying are taught, in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to what is taught at the <i>Ecoles Chrétiennes</i>.</p>

<p>There are at present in these latter schools 300 boys and 150
girls in all.</p>

<p>The department pays the expenses of these schools.</p>

<p>The girls received in the private boarding schools, where they
learn to read, to write, and to sew, amount to the number of about
600. This is entirely a private act of charity.</p>

<p>The number of girls received by the Sisters of Charity amounts
to about 900.</p>

<p>There has also been established within the last year a model
infant school, founded by private subscriptions, for the children of
labourers and journeymen artisans. At present, however, it is so
little known, that it is of very little importance.</p>

<h6><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h6>

<p>Bourdeaux is the only town of the department which possesses
any establishments of this kind, viz., the Hospital of Incurables
(<i>Hospice des Incurables</i>), and that of the old people (<i>Hospice
des Vieillards</i>).</p>

<p>These two establishments support 300 old people. This number
falls very short of that which the population requires. The
requisite qualifications for admission are, to have passed the age of
60, and to prove that the candidate has no means of subsistence.</p>

<p>It may be added, that at Bourdeaux the number of old people
who are candidates for admittance to these hospitals amounts to
300, and that on an average a vacancy occurs for each at the end
of four years at the <i>Hospital des Incurables</i>, and two years at
<i>Hospice des Vieillards</i>, and that all these claimants find either in
their families, the <i>Secours à Domicile</i>, or private charity, means of
subsistence.</p>

<h6><i>Sick.</i></h6>

<p>The department possesses, for the reception of the sick, a small
hospital at Bazas; one at St. Macaire, and one at La Réole; a
more extensive one at Blaye and Libourne, and the great hospital
at Bourdeaux.</p>

<p>The great hospital of Bourdeaux contains always from 600 to
650 sick. The daily admittances average 30; the discharges, 28,
and the deaths two.</p>

<p>No distinction is made as to country, &amp;c. either in admittance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
treatment, or discharge.</p>

<p>The inmates of this hospital are generally composed of inhabitants
of the town, who are too poor to be treated at home, or who
prefer the care that is taken of them there to that which they
would experience at home; of workmen, &amp;c. from the neighbouring
departments employed in the town, and who have nowhere
else to go; of peasants, even in easy circumstances, who, from
illness or accidents, have not the same resources at home.</p>

<p>Bourdeaux possesses a <i>Hospice de la Maternité</i>, or Lying-in
Hospital, and a society, founded by private benefactions, for the
same purpose.</p>

<p>The Lying-in Hospital is an asylum in which any woman who
presents herself in the ninth month of her pregnancy, whatever
may be her state, her country or condition, is admitted without
difficulty, without question or inquiry, under the name she pleases,
and in such a manner, that the fear of being known or discovered
may not prevent those who wish to remain unknown from benefiting
by the institution.</p>

<p>Women admitted at the ninth month remain in the establishment
till they have completely recovered their lying-in. (p. 231.)</p>

<p>The number of those women, either lying-in or subsisted in the
hospital, varies from 35 to 60, and their stay is about 30 days.
The births amount annually from 400 to 450; upon this number,
30 or 40 at most are kept and suckled by their mothers; the rest
are abandoned and sent to the Foundling Hospital.</p>

<p>Among these inmates, about one-fifth is composed of married
women, who have no means of being confined at home; two-fifths
of young girls of the town, chiefly servants; the rest of peasants,
who leave their homes in order not to be discovered.</p>

<p>Illegitimate children deserted by their parents, and which are
deposited at the Foundling Hospital, are clothed and nourished by
women in the institution, till a nurse out of it can be procured.</p>

<p>These children, after being suckled, remain with their nurses
till the age of 12 years. At this age, if the individuals who have
brought them up do not wish to keep them gratuitously till their
majority and give them a trade, they return to the hospital, and
they then cease to be at the charge of the special funds. The establishment
itself provides for their expenses; and until they can
be placed as apprentices, they receive, in the Bourdeaux hospital,
the rudiments of reading and writing, and they are taught some
trade.</p>

<p>Once placed as apprentices, they remain with the master till the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
age of 21, when they are to shift for themselves.</p>

<p>Those that cannot be placed, or are infirm, remain in the hospital,
and form a sort of permanent population there.</p>

<p>Children whose parents are known, and who are living, but
have either disappeared or are confined, are received in the same
way as foundlings, the mode of admission differing only. This
must be granted by the prefect after an inquest. For the remainder,
they enjoy the same advantages as the foundlings.</p>

<p>As to orphans, they are also admitted into the Foundling Hospital,
upon the order of the administrative commission, after information
as to the state of the family. At Bourdeaux the orphans
of the town alone are received. Those of the rest of the department
remain at the charge of their parishes, and generally live by
alms. The orphans received into the hospital enjoy the same
privileges as the foundlings and deserted children.</p>

<p>The annual exposal of children amounts at Bourdeaux to 900,
comprising all those abandoned at the Lying-in Hospital, those of
the town, and those sent from the various parts of the department,
as well as from the neighbouring departments.</p>

<p>From 10 to 15 deserted children, and the same number of orphans,
are annually admitted.</p>

<p>The population of the hospital amounts generally to 40 new-born
infants, waiting to be sent to nurse; 150 children beginning
their apprenticeships, and waiting to be placed; about 150 infirm
of all ages forming the permanent part of the population.</p>

<p>The number of children from the age of one month to that of
12 years, amounts to 3,600; and that of children above 12 and
below 21 apprenticed out, amounts to above 1,500.</p>

<p>The expenditure of the hospital, comprising the clothing for the
children brought up out of the establishment, amounts to 110,000
francs per annum (4,400<i>l.</i>) That for the nurses or board in the
country, to 240.000 francs (9,600<i>l.</i>), of which</p>

<p>104,000 fr. (4,160<i>l.</i>) is given by the government upon the
common departmental fund.</p>

<p>27,000 fr. (1,080<i>l.</i>) taken from the revenue of the town of
Bourdeaux.</p>

<p>60,000 fr. (2,400<i>l.</i>) voted by the general council on the <i>Centimes
Facultatifs</i>.</p>

<p>49,000 fr. (1,960<i>l.</i>) on the revenue of the other parishes of
the department.</p>

</div>

<p>Owing to the extreme carelessness and entire absence of frugality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
on the part of the peasantry and other classes of labourers, it
is impossible to give an accurate account of their expenditure. They
live entirely from hand to mouth; and nine-tenths are in debt for
the common necessaries of life. The men are addicted to gambling,
and the women spend the greater part of what they earn in
useless articles of dress. As to the expenditure for schooling and
religious teaching, no provision is thought of.</p>

this department, it will be seen that it supports
its population with a smaller number of deaths,

<p>Mendicity, under the head of vagrancy, is not prevalent in the
department of the Lower Pyrenees; the relief afforded to French
subjects passing through the department, seeking work (which seldom
occurs), or returning to their native places, is at the rate of
three sols per league, or ½<i>d.</i> per mile; but this relief is more
frequently granted to foreigners in distress, and is paid by the
several mayors at certain stations or towns on their route. There
is no public relief granted to vagrants living by begging.</p>

<h6><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h6>

<p>There are no public or private establishments or relief afforded
to the destitute able-bodied or their families; but this description
of pauper is seldom or ever to be met with in this department.</p>

<h6><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h6>

<p>There are no public or religious institutions or regulations for
the relief of the poor in general; they subsist by begging; and
when no longer able to do so, they receive a trifling relief from
“The Ladies of Charity” (Dames de la Charité), who make
quarterly collections from the respectable inhabitants, which these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
ladies distribute in food, fuel, or money, to the <i>pauvres honteux</i>,
or infirm, as the case may be; but this private voluntary subscription
is very inadequate.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Bayonne (and it is hoped and expected that
the example will be followed in other places) are now occupied in
forming, by voluntary annual subscriptions, an establishment
for the relief of the poor; a commission of gentlemen has been
appointed, and there is every prospect that this charitable undertaking
will be crowned with success.</p>

<h6><i>Sick.</i></h6>

<p>In the towns there are public hospitals for the sick and wounded;
but when convalescent, they are obliged immediately to quit the
hospital, destitute or not.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Children.</span></h6>

<p class="center"><i>Illegitimate.</i></p>

<p>Illegitimate children (infants only) are received into the hospitals
established by the famous St. Vincent de Paul, but where the
parents have no communication with or control over them; these
children are placed out to nurse in the country at about 5<i>s.</i> a
month, and are afterward provided for by the hospital, if in the
course of seven years they are not claimed by the parents.</p>

<p>When not deposited in the hospitals, the mothers have invariably
been found to bestow upon their infants the most scrupulous care
and attention, the natural consequence of having had the firmness
and humanity not to abandon their offspring, notwithstanding the
facility of concealment held out to them by the hospital.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Orphans or Deserted Children.</i></p>

<p>There are no public or private institutions or regulations for
orphans.</p>

<p><i>Deserted Children.</i>&mdash;There are no public or private regulations
or institutions under this head; but I have not heard of a case in
question in this department.</p>

<h6><i>Cripples, Deaf and Dumb, and Blind.</i></h6>

<p><i>Cripples.</i>&mdash;Obliged to beg if destitute, there being no public or
private institutions or regulations for cripples.</p>

<p>The deaf and dumb, if poor and destitute, are obliged to beg;
there are excellent establishments in the large towns for their
instruction, for those who have the means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Blind.</i>&mdash;Obliged to beg, there are no public or private institutions
for them.</p>

<h6><i>Idiots and Lunatics.</i></h6>

<p>There are no public or private institutions for idiots.</p>

<p>There is an institution (Maison de Force) for the admission of
lunatics at the Chef Lieu of the department only (at Pau).</p>

<p>The questions relative to hired country labourers are not altogether
applicable to this department, which is invariably divided into
small farms, not exceeding from 20 to 30 English acres each, the
families on each farm sufficing for the cultivation thereof, the proprietors
or the farmers being themselves the labourers of the soil,
the neighbours assisting each other in time of harvest; consequently
it seldom occurs that a hired labourer is called in; but
when employed they are paid at the rate of about 1<i>s.</i> per diem,
without food. The women, and the children from the age of 10
years, constantly work on the land. The children generally
receive a primary education at the village day schools, where there
is always a schoolmaster or mistress appointed by the authorities;
price of education, 2 francs (about 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>) per month. At these
schools the children are prepared for their first communion; they
learn reading, writing, and calculation. The food of the proprietor
or farmer labourer chiefly consists in vegetable soups,
potatoes, salt fish, pork, bacon, &amp;c., and seldom or ever butcher’s
meat, and invariably Indian corn bread, homebaked. These
persons (who are generally the owners of the soil) procure for
themselves a comfortable subsistence, but they are seldom able to
lay by anything. The equal division of the land prevents in a
great measure mendicity. The families on each farm in the
whole department consist on an average of about five persons.</p>

<p>It is calculated that persons attain a more advanced age in this
department than in any other in France.</p>

<h6><i>Vagrants.</i></h6>

<p>It has been calculated that the average number of beggars in
this department (the Mouths of the Rhone) is 1060, whereof 900
are natives and 105 strangers, besides 240 who traverse the
department. The calculation having been made some years ago,
the numbers may have increased with the population, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
then 313,000, and is now 359,000.</p>

<p>The only relief granted to the poor travelling is by giving them
a “passport d’indigent,” furnished by the local authorities, in
which their exact route is designated, and not to be deviated from;
they receive, as they pass through each commune, three sous for
every league of distance, equal to a halfpenny per mile, and
lodging for the night: beggars have no relief but private charity.</p>

<h6><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h6>

<p>The principal establishment at Marseilles for their relief is
the bureau de bienfaisance, whose revenues, arising partly from
the remnant property of some charitable institutions existing
before the revolution, partly from an annual allowance granted by
the budget of the commune, partly by a tax on theatrical admissions,
and from private subscriptions, amount altogether to about
140,000 francs, or 5600<i>l.</i>, of which the major part is distributed
in money to the “pauvres honteux” (those who have seen better
days), and in providing necessaries and medical assistance for the
poor in general, by five directors, and at their sole discretion.
Similar establishments exist in the other arrondissements of this
department, but, with the exception of Aix, with very small
means, principally dependent on the commune budgets, which, in
many cases, furnish nothing. I am informed that in this commune,
with a population of 140,000 inhabitants, the bureau relieves,
more or less, 800 families of “pauvres honteux” and 4000
families of indigent poor. There is also at Marseilles a société de
bienfaisance, supported principally by private charity, whose chief
object is the establishment of soup kitchens and dispensaries for
the relief of the poor, and a school for the education of their
children from four to nine years of age. No relief is ever given
in money. Their annual revenue is about 40,000 francs, or
1600<i>l.</i>; and in times of great distress the local administration
increases its funds, and supplies the poor with soup through its
means.</p>

<p>The number of children received in the school above-mentioned
is about 200: they receive two meals a day and sleep at home;
they are taught various trades, and apprenticed at the expense of
the commune; there are also several gratuitous day-schools for
children of the age of seven years and upwards, and who bring
their own food.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h6><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h6>

<p>The only public establishment for the reception of this class is
that called “La Charité,” in which those are admitted who have
attained the age of seventy, and none before; the number of those
individuals at present is about 350; they are there boarded,
clothed, and fed.</p>

<h6><i>Sick.</i></h6>

<p>There are no district institutions for the reception of the sick,
except the general hospitals. The average number of sick in the
hospital of Marseilles may be about 450.</p>

<h6><i>Children.</i></h6>

<p>One large branch of the administration of hospitals of Marseilles
is “La Charité,” which receives, as before mentioned, old
men, and also all children under twelve years of age, whether
illegitimate, orphans, foundlings, or deserted; they are there
received, and, when infants, principally nursed in the country. At
this time there are 2240 infants in this situation, and on their
return they are boarded, lodged, and educated.</p>

<h3>SARDINIAN STATES.</h3>

<p>The information respecting the Sardinian States
consists of answers from Piedmont, Genoa, and
Savoy, obtained by Sir Augustus Foster from the
Minister of the Interior, from M. de Vignet, a
Senator of Chambery, from Marquis Brignole Sale,
Syndic of Genoa, and from the Marquis Cavour,
Syndic of Turin, and his son, Count Camille
Cavour.</p>

<p>The following extracts comprise their most material
contents. (Pages 653, 654, 655, 656, 657, 659,
660, 661, 662.)</p>

<p>The general system appears to resemble that of
France, except that in Piedmont mendicity is not an
offence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Piedmont</span>.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<h5><i>Mendicants.</i></h5>

<p>Mendicity is not forbidden by law; every person who is considered
unable to obtain by his own industry subsistence for himself
and his family may station himself in the streets, and ask
charity of the passers by. The government and the local authorities
have often, but in vain, endeavoured to repress the innumerable
abuses which have followed. But the regulations which
have been made for this purpose have been ineffectual and even
nugatory. The law, however, which forbids the poor to beg out
of their parishes, is frequently put in force. When a great number
of strangers are found begging in a town, the municipal
authorities drive them out <i>en masse</i>, leaving it to the gendarmerie
to oblige them to return to their country, or to the places considered
to be their homes. But as the law in question is not
enforced by any punishment, if they find any difficulty in living
at home, they soon return to violate it afresh.</p>

<p>There are no means of ascertaining, even by approximation,
the total number of mendicants. It depends, too, in part on
many causes continually varying; such as good or bad harvests,
hard or mild winters, and the changes of employment in those
trades which afford subsistence to many hands. It is spread,
however, over the whole country, but in different degrees. In
the valleys of the Alps it scarcely exists; in those of the Apennines
it is considerable, as is generally the case where chestnuts
are the ordinary food of the lower orders.</p>

<p>If a labouring man, not domiciled in the place of his residence,
finds himself, from accident or illness, unable either to earn his
living, or to reach his home, the authorities, both of his temporary
residence, and of the places that lie in his route homewards,
are required to supply to him the means of travelling. In
Turin, a small pecuniary assistance is given to all workpeople
who wish to return to their own homes, but this is not a general
practice.</p>

<h5><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h5>

<p><i>Are there any establishments for the reception of the destitute
able-bodied and their families, in which they are set to work,
and furnished with food and clothes?</i></p>

<p>There are none. The only attempt of the sort was one made
some years ago at Raconis, and it failed almost immediately,
among difficulties and bad consequences of every description.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
An establishment called Ergastolo exists near Turin, in which
young vagrants are confined and kept to constant work; but
although a person may be committed to it without trial on a
simple order from the police, it is considered rather as a house
of correction than a workhouse.</p>

<p>There are still convents at whose doors soup, bread, and other
kinds of food are distributed. But this deplorable practice is not
now sufficiently prevalent to produce a sensible effect except in
some parts of the Genoese coast, where the mendicant orders are
the most numerous, and the poverty the greatest.</p>

<p>Many charitable institutions have ecclesiastical forms and
names, but their attention is almost confined to the sick and the
impotent. When a bad harvest or a hard winter occasions much
distress, the municipal authorities, either spontaneously or on the
suggestion and with the aid of the government, undertake public
works in order to give employment to the able-bodied. This is
more frequent in the large towns, such as Turin and Genoa.</p>

<h6><i>To what extent do they obtain relief in kind and in money?</i></h6>

<p>They never receive either from the government or from the municipal
authorities; what they get is from private charity. But
on some great occasions, such as the anniversary of the Restoration
of the Monarchy, or the celebration of the King’s Birth-day, food
and clothes are distributed among some of the most needy families.</p>

<p>Many of the towns have <i>Monts-de-piété</i>, which lend on pledges
at 6 per cent., but under very rigorous rules. If the unhappy
borrower cannot redeem the pledge before the fixed time, it is sold,
whatever may be its value, for the amount of the debt. In spite of
this, the number of people who have recourse to them is immense.
I do not think I exaggerate in saying that there are very few poor
housekeepers some of whose furniture or clothes is not thus in
pawn.</p>

<h5><i>Impotent through Age.</i></h5>

<p>1. <i>Are there hospitals for the reception of those who through
age are incapable of earning their subsistence?</i></p>

<p>There are none avowedly for this purpose, but there are several
intended for incurables, into which those whose only infirmity is
old age, manage to get received.</p>

<p>2. <i>Do they receive relief in kind and in money at their own
homes?</i>
They receive none from the government or the municipal authorities,
but such relief is afforded by many charitable institutions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
In Turin, for example, the congregation of St. Paul has large
revenues; and by law, there ought in every parish to be a charitable
association. But, in fact, none are to be found excepting in
some villages and towns; almost all the rural parishes are without
them. The resources of those which exist arise from endowments,
from donations, and from periodical collections made in churches,
or from house to house. <i>These associations certainly do much
good, but being subjected to no general rules or central control,
their proceedings are neither uniform nor regular; a source of
enormous abuse, which, in the present state of things, it is impossible
to correct or even to verify.</i></p>

<p>Much charity is also given through the hands of the clergy.
This is, without any doubt, the best distributed, and the most
effectual; much of it is devoted to the aged and impotent.</p>

<h5><i>The Sick.</i></h5>

<p>In all the towns, and in many of the large villages, there are
hospitals in which any individual suffering under acute sickness,
or casualty, may be nursed until his perfect recovery. The
principal acute complaint is fever. But there are few hospitals
for chronic or incurable cases, and few such patients can obtain
access to them: they are, therefore, in general left to private
charity.</p>

<p>The hospitals have in general property in land, in the public
funds, or lent on mortgage, and when these revenues are insufficient,
they are assisted from the local assessments of the parishes
and provinces, and by charitable persons. The management of
the different hospitals is not uniform; it is in general much under
the influence of the government. In some towns, the ecclesiastical
authorities and the chapters interfere, and it is in such cases in
general that there is most of disorder and abuse. In most parishes
the indigent sick receive gratuitous treatment from the physicians
and surgeons, who are paid an annual salary by the municipal
authorities, or the charitable associations. In Turin, and in
some other places, there are dispensaries, distributing gratis,
to those who have a certificate of poverty from their clergyman,
the most usual and necessary remedies, whenever medically ordered.
In general, the sick who cannot procure admission to the
hospitals are in a pitiable state of poverty and distress.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Children</span>.</h5>

<h6><i>Illegitimate.</i></h6>

<p>If an unmarried woman has a child by an unmarried man, she
has recourse to the ecclesiastical tribunal, that is to say, to the
episcopal court of the diocese to compel him to marry her. If
she succeeds in proving her previous good conduct, and that promises,
or other means of seduction were employed against her,
the tribunal orders the marriage. The defendant may refuse;
but in that case the cause is carried before the civil judges, who
admitting the seduction as already proved, award to her damages,
regulated by the circumstances of the case.</p>

<p>The child is by law entitled to an allowance for its maintenance,
which may be demanded from either parent.</p>

<p>It is to be observed that, in consequence of the constant inclination
of the ecclesiastical tribunal, in favour of the female plaintiff,
in order that the harm done may be repaired by marriage,
and the ease with which children are disposed of in the Foundling
Hospitals, few illegitimate children are brought up at home,
even in the lowest classes of society.</p>

<p>If the seducer is a member of the family, and under the authority
of his father, the girl in general has recourse to his parents
for the damages awarded to her. The illegitimate child may claim
its allowance from its paternal or maternal grandfather; and if
its father and mother have died without leaving it any provision,
may claim one from those who have succeeded to their property.</p>

<h6><span class="smcap">Foundlings, Orphans, and Deserted Children</span>.</h6>

<p>Many towns have hospitals for foundlings. Their parents may
remain perfectly unknown; they have only to deposit the child at
night in a wheel which in all these hospitals communicates with
the street and with the interior of the house, ring a bell to warn
the person on the watch, and go away. The wheel turns, the
child is received into the hospital, and numbered, and no further
trace remains of the transaction.</p>

<p>Genoa possesses a splendid orphan establishment; and there is
one in Turin for girls only. But they are far from being sufficient
for this numerous and interesting class. There is no further
public assistance for orphans and deserted children; they are
thrown on private charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Cripples, Deaf and Dumb, and Blind</span>.</h5>

<p>There is no establishment for persons maimed or deformed.
Even in the surgical hospitals, as soon as a patient no longer
requires the assistance of art, he is dismissed, even if he should
have lost the use of his limbs.</p>

<p>In Genoa there is an establishment for the deaf and dumb,
which enjoys a well-founded celebrity. On certain conditions
poor children are gratuitously admitted. There is no institution
for the blind, or any further public relief for any of the classes in
question: they are left to private charity.</p>

<h5><i>Idiots and Insane.</i></h5>

<p>There are two large establishments for the insane, one at Turin,
the other at Genoa. In each a small payment is made, in respect
of the lunatic, either out of his own property, or, if he has none,
by his parish or province. In some rare cases insane persons are
received gratuitously.</p>

<p>Some mountain districts, and particularly in the valley of Aoste,
contain many of the idiots, commonly called Cretins. They are
in general gentle and inoffensive, and the objects of the pity and
zealous assistance of all around them, so much so that it is never
necessary to place them in an hospital. The interesting popular
belief that a special protection of heaven is attached to the house
inhabited by a Cretin is well known.</p>

<h5><i>Effects of these Institutions.</i></h5>

<p>It is not to the encouragement given by public charity that the
great number of premature and improvident marriages contracted
in this country is to be imputed. With the exception of those
between professional beggars, we owe the greater part of them,
first, to the natural disposition of ignorant and rude persons to
follow, without reflection, the passions of the moment, and,
secondly, to the blind zeal with which the clergy and bigotted
people encourage all kinds of marriages, with the erroneous idea
of thus preventing the immorality and scandal of illegitimate
connexions. Nor are family ties affected by the charitable institutions.
Whatever those may be, the poor man ever considers his
relations as his sole support against adversity. Besides, as the
Roman law with respect to paternal authority has been preserved
among us unimpaired, family union is more easy and common
than anywhere else.</p>

<p>Though some individuals, skilled in working on the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
compassion, may gain more than the average wages of labour,
we cannot compare the results of the honest and independent
labourer’s industry with the mendicant’s profits: so immense is the
difference between the honourable existence of the one, and the
humiliation, debasement, and moral degradation of the other.</p>

</div>

<h4>GENOA.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Public mendicity not being at present forbidden, it is difficult
to ascertain the number of professed mendicants. Those
on the town of Genoa may however be estimated at, at least, 200.
If we add to these their families, or at least those members of
their families who exist on the profit of their begging, the whole
mendicant population may amount to from 600 to 700<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>.</p>

<p>2. The unemployed poor, not being mendicants, are relieved at
their own homes by the “magistrat de misèricorde,” the “dames
de misèricorde,” and by other governors of charities, out of the
revenue of many pious bequests, with the administration of which
they are charged.</p>

<p>3. The children of the poor, to whatever class they may belong,
are gratuitously instructed in the primary public schools, under
the direction of the municipal authorities. Six of these schools
are for boys, and two for girls.</p>

<p>4. There is a mont de piété in Genoa, from which the poor can
borrow on pledge; at 8 per cent. interest.</p>

<p>5. The poor of all ages, from the earliest childhood, who are
natives of the town of Genoa, are gratuitously received, lodged,
and fed, in the poor hospital, as far as the means of that establishment
will go. The poor of the other parts of the duchy are also
received there on payment of a small allowance.</p>

<p>6. There are two large hospitals in Genoa, one for the treatment
of acute disorders, the other for the incurables and insane.
Another lunatic asylum has been just begun, and there is a small
establishment in the suburbs for leprosy and other diseases of the
skin.</p>

<p>7. The “Conservatoire des Sœurs de St. Joseph,” and a charitable
institution, called “Notre Dame de la Providence,” furnish
in pursuance of their rules, medical and surgical advice, and
remedies to the poor who do not publicly solicit relief [pauvres
honteux].</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>8. Poor lying-in women, born in the town, or domiciled there
for the three previous years, are received and nursed gratuitously
in the great hospital, called “de Pammatone.”</p>

<p>9. The same hospital receives illegitimate and deserted children,
if secretly placed on the turning box. The hospital takes the
charge of the boys until 12 years old, and of the girls until their
marriage or death. Ten poor lunatics and idiots, natives of Genoa,
are gratuitously received in the hospital for the incurables and
insane. Those of the other parts of the duchy, and those who are
not poor, are also received there, on paying a sum proportionate to
the sort of food given to them.</p>

<div class="footnotes">

<h4>SAVOY.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Mendicity is very common in the environs of Chambery
and the Haute Tarentaise. In the other provinces it is not more
extensive than in Florence, and much less so than in Italy. In
1789, the total number of mendicants was 3688. Under the
French dominion it rose to 4360. Since that time it has much
diminished, partly from the diminution of the public taxes, and
partly from the discontinuance of the sales of property which were
enforced by the French treasury against the relations of refractory
conscripts, and by Genoese creditors against their debtors. It
cannot now be estimated at more than 2500.</p>

<p>2. Vagrant mendicity being prohibited by law, beggars have
no right to relief. The town of Chambery contains a depôt de
mendicité, in which 100 paupers are endeavoured to be kept to
work.</p>

<p>3. The duchy possesses nearly 250 charitable establishments,
possessing funds distinct to the relief of the poor of the place in
which they are situated. Their resources are very far from being
sufficient for that purpose, especially in years of bad harvests. But
poor families are assisted by their neighbours, their relations, the
clergy, and other charitable persons in their parishes. This relief
is distributed in the town of Chambery, according to a simple
and excellent system. The poor are divided into 24 districts,
each confided to a committee consisting of three ladies of charity
(dames de charité), belonging in general to the highest class of
society. Each committee seeks out, registers, and superintends
the poor of its district, gives secret assistance to those families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
who would be disgraced by the publicity of their situation, and
withdraws relief from the unworthy. The resources of the dames
de charité consist only of one tenth of the price of the theatrical
tickets, of the great public collections (quêtes) made at Easter and
Christmas, and of some secret gifts from individuals. If this establishment
were rich enough to provide employment for indigent
families at their own homes, it would be far superior to all other
charitable institutions.</p>

<p>We have as yet spoken of the relief given to those who have no
plea beyond that of mere poverty. For those who have some
other claim there are several institutions. The Hospice de Charité
of Chambery receives 171 persons, consisting of orphans, infirm
persons, and old men. The “Asyle de St. Benoit” in the same
town is destined to the old of both sexes who once were in easy
circumstances; and the Orphan House educates young girls without
fortune belonging to the middling classes, in such a manner as
to enable them to earn an independent subsistence.</p>

<p>4. The Duchy of Savoy now possesses a great number of gratuitous
religious schools, receiving, among others, the children of
the poor. At Chambery the two schools de la Doctrine and de
St. Joseph provide education for more than 700 children of both
sexes, four-fifths of whom could not pay for it.</p>

<p>5. There is no Mont-de-Piété in Savoy.</p>

<p>6. Chambery contains a hospital with 80 beds, all constantly
occupied. There are also institutions for the relief of those suffering
under incurable or contagious disease, and for sick travellers.
There are also hospitals for the sick at Annecy, Thonon, St. Jean-de-Maurienne,
Montmelian, Moûtiers, Yenne, la Roche, la Motte-Servolex,
and Thônes.</p>

<p>7. Many establishments of sisters of charity have been founded,
either by parishes, or by opulent individuals, for the relief of the
sick at their own homes. But with respect to the poorest classes
it has been necessary to abandon this kind of relief, as they either
neglected to use the remedies supplied to them, or used them with
fatal imprudence. It can safely be bestowed on those only whose
situation is raised above actual poverty.</p>

<p>8. Lying-in women, married or unmarried, are received at
Chambery in the Hospice de Maternité.</p>

<p>9. In Chambery, and in Thonon, the greater part of the illegitimate
children, whatever be the circumstances of their parents,
are taken, the first night after their birth, to the foundling hospitals,
which receive them, though clandestinely deposited. Those born
in the distant provinces are generally brought up by their mothers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and partake their fortune, or their poverty.</p>

<p>10. At some distance from Chambery a hospital has been established,
intended for the gratuitous reception of 60 lunatics. But
as yet it has had room for only 20. The others are at the charge
of their parishes.</p>

<p>The class of day labourers, such as it exists in England, is not
at all numerous in Savoy, almost all the population consisting of
proprietors. Out of 102,000 families in the Duchy, 85,000 heads
of families are owners of some portion of land; 80,000 of them
subsist by agriculture. There is therefore little employment for
day labourers. According to the enumerations of 1789 and 1801
the number of persons, including both sexes, and artisans, as well
as agriculturists, employed in day labour in that part of Savoy,
which formed after 1789 the departement de Mont Blanc, did not
exceed from 9000 to 10,000 individuals, which would make for the
whole Duchy more than from 14,000 to 15,000 such individuals.
The day labourers in general hire, from a small proprietor, part of a
cottage, and half an acre, or an acre of land, at the rent of from
60 to 100 francs, which they work out. Saving is a thing almost
unknown in Savoy. With the rich people and with the poor,
from the gentleman to the peasant, it is unusual and even strange
to put a revenue to any other use than that of spending it. A
few men of business, and usurers, are the only persons who think
of augmenting their patrimonies. Sometimes indeed a merchant
or a manufacturer will economise something from his profits, but
with no other object than that of procuring a country-house, which
from that time swallows up all that he can spare.</p>

<p>The poor never apply for relief to the authorities, but always to
private charity; and it is inexhaustible, for (except during the
famine of the year 1817) no one has ever perished from want.
Vagrants are forced to return to their parishes, or, if foreigners,
driven out of the country.</p>

<h3>VENICE.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">Population
about
112,000.</div>

<p>Mr. Money’s Report from Venice is so concise
that we insert the whole (pp. 663, 634). We cannot
perfectly reconcile the statement at the beginning,
that there is no compulsory legal provision for the
poor; and that at the end, that every commune is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
bound to support the poor and indigent within its
limits. Perhaps Mr. Money uses the word “bound”
in a moral, not a legal sense.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. Is there any compulsory legal provision for the poor in
Venice?&mdash;None.</p>

<p>2. In what manner are the funds arising from voluntary donations
collected in Venice?&mdash;There is a commission of public
charity, composed of the laity of the first rank and consideration
in Venice, at the head of which is the patriarch.</p>

<p>All sums destined for the relief of the poor and the indigent,
from whatever source, are placed at the disposal of this commission.</p>

<p>These funds arise from bequests, which are numerous, from
voluntary contributions, from collections made by lay associations
in each of the 30 parishes, which hold their meetings either at the
church or at the house of the priest; sometimes from the produce
of a lottery; and by a singular contrivance of the late patriarch,
to render an old custom of complimentary visits on New Year’s-day
contributory to the purposes of charity, he had it announced,
that all who would subscribe to the funds of the commission of
public charity should have their names published, and be exempted
from the costly ceremony above adverted to.</p>

<p>3. By what authority are they distributed?&mdash;By that of the
same commission, which receives the reports of the state of the
poor in the several parishes, and particularly inquires into the
circumstances of every case.</p>

<p>4. What constitutes a claim to relief, and how is that claim investigated?&mdash;Among
the lower classes, extreme poverty without
the means of obtaining subsistence, or incapability from age or
sickness to labour for it. This is certified by the parish priest to
the association mentioned in answer to query No. 2, which makes
itself acquainted with every case of distress. But there is great
distress to be relieved among those who once constituted the
higher classes of society, but whose families, since the fall of the
Republic, have, from various causes, fallen into decay; these
make their application direct to the commission, and are relieved
according to their necessities and the state of their funds.
5. What is the amount of relief usually given in each case, and
for what length of time is it usually continued?&mdash;The amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
relief given, according to the class and circumstances of the distressed,
is from 10 cents. to 65 cents. per head per day (or from
3<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> sterling.)&mdash;[<i>Sic in orig.</i>]</p>

<p>These alms are continued as long as the parish priest certifies
the need of those of the lower classes, or the commission, through
its inquiries, are satisfied of the necessities of the others.</p>

<p>6. Is relief given by taking the poor into almshouses or houses
of industry, or by giving them relief at home; and in the latter
case, is it given in money or in food and clothing?&mdash;There are no
almshouses in Venice, but there are houses of industry, where
work of various descriptions is provided for those who are able to
work. Relief is given to many at home, but to most upon their
personal appearance before some of the members of the commission.</p>

<p>In winter, relief is afforded by the commission, both in food and
clothing.</p>

<p>7. What is the number of persons in Venice usually receiving
relief, and what is the least and greatest number known during
the last 10 years?&mdash;The number usually receiving relief, and
which is the least number during the last 10 years, is about
47,000; the greatest number in the last 10 years was about
50,000. The last year 42,705<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> received relief, either at home or
by personal application to the commission, and the number in
houses of industry and hospitals was 4667.</p>

<p>8. Is there much difficulty in procuring sufficient funds for the
support of the poor in times of distress, or is the supply so large
as at all to diminish the industry and providence of the working
classes?&mdash;It has been found impossible to procure sufficient
funds for the support of the poor at Venice, and there never was
so large a supply as at all to diminish the industry and providence
of the working classes. When the funds prove insufficient, the
commune contribute, and after their contributions, whatever is
deficient is supplied by the Government.</p>

<p>9. Do cases of death by starvation ever occur?&mdash;Do the poorer
classes afford much assistance to one another in time of sickness
or want of employment?&mdash;Cases of death by starvation never
occur. Even during the great distress caused by the blockade in
1813, and the famine in 1817, no occurrence of this kind was
known. In fact, the more urgent the circumstances are, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
more abundant are the subscriptions and donations.</p>

<p>The poorer classes are remarkable for their kindness to each
other in times of sickness and need. Many instances of this have
fallen under my own observation.</p>

<p>10. Is there a foundling hospital at Venice, and if so, what is
the number of infants annually admitted into it?&mdash;There is a
foundling hospital in Venice, which was instituted in 1346, and
the number received into it annually is between 400 and 500. I
have known seven found in the receptacle in one morning.</p>

<p>Each child is immediately given to a wet nurse; at the end of
seven or eight days it is vaccinated, and sent to nurse in the
country.</p>

<p>11. Do members of the same family, among the poorer classes
in general, show much disposition to assist one another in distress,
sickness, or old age?&mdash;There is much family affection in all
classes of the Venetians, and in sickness, distress, and old age,
among the poorer classes, they show every disposition to assist
and relieve each other.</p>

<p>The clergy, who have great influence over the lower classes,
exert themselves much to cultivate the good feeling which subsists
among them towards one another.</p>

<p>12. Have you any other observations to make on the relief
afforded to the poor at Venice?&mdash;Besides the voluntary contributions
and the assistance of the commune and the Government, the
several charitable institutions (of which there are no less than 10)
in this city, have annual incomes derivable from various bequests
in land and other property, amounting to 483,000 Austrian livres
(or 16,000<i>l.</i> sterling). Last year the commune contributed
359,000 Austrian livres (or 11,970<i>l.</i> sterling) and the Government
460,000 Austrian livres (or 15,330<i>l.</i> sterling). The Government
contributes annually for the foundlings and the insane
of the eight Venetian provinces, 1,000,000 of Austrian livres
(33,000<i>l.</i> sterling). I should remark, that among other resources
which the commission of public charity have at their command, is
a tax upon the theatres and other places of public amusement.</p>

<p>The total expenditure of the commission of public charity may
be taken approximately at 3,000,000 of Austrian livres, or
100,000<i>l.</i> sterling annually, for the city of Venice alone, which is
now declared to contain a population of 112,000.</p>

<p>Mendicity is not permitted in the streets of Venice, and although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
distress does force mendicants to appear when they can escape
the vigilance of the police, yet I do not believe that 20 beggars
are to be met with in this large and populous city.</p>

<p>The poor in every parish in Venice have the benefit of a physician,
a surgeon and medicines gratis; the expense of these is paid
by the commune.</p>

<p>Every commune in the Venetian provinces is bound to support
the poor and the indigent within its limits, whether they be natives
of the commune or not. No commune or parish can remove
from it a pauper, because he may have been born in another. Ten
years’ residence entitles a man to a settlement in a different parish
from that of his birth. When a commune to which a pauper does
not belong affords him relief, it is always reimbursed by his own
parish.</p>

<p>Every commune derives funds from local taxes; the communes
of towns from taxes on certain articles of consumption; the communes
in the country, where articles of consumption are not taxed,
from an addition to the capitation tax, which is levied by the
State, but all communes have, more or less, sources of revenue
from land, houses, and charitable bequests, which are very frequent
in these states.</p>

<p>The number of foundlings at present in the country under the
age of 12 years is 2300. After that age the child is transferred
from the family who have the charge of it, and apprenticed to learn
some craft or trade, or servitude; but so kind-hearted are the people
in the Venetian provinces, that in numerous instances, from attachment
to the child which they have reared, they have begged, when
the time arrived for its removal, to be allowed to keep it as their
own.</p>

<h3>PORTUGAL AND ITS DEPENDENCIES.</h3>

<p>The information from Portugal and its dependencies
consists of answers from Oporto, the Azores
and the Canary Islands, to the Commissioners’
questions. The following extracts show the general
state of these countries. (pp. 642, 643, 644,
645, 647, 686, 687.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<h4>PORTUGAL.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Although poverty prevails to a great extent in Portugal, still
the frugal habits and very limited wants and desires of the lower
classes of the population in the northern provinces prevent mendicity
from showing itself in those offensive and distressing forms
which it assumes in many other countries. The very limited provision
which has been made for the poor by the Government, or by
public regulation, throws them on their own resources, and makes
them careful and provident. Although, during the late siege of
Oporto, we issued at one period gratuitously, from a soup society,
upwards of 6,000 rations of soup each day, the number of absolute
mendicants who were relieved fell greatly short of 1,000.
The remainder of the applicants were principally families reduced
to distress by the circumstances of the times, who withdrew their
claims as soon as the termination of the blockade opened to them
other resources and means of support.</p>

<p>Persons destitute of resources, who may be travelling in search
of work or otherwise, can claim no pecuniary relief; but the different
religious establishments are in the habit of affording a temporary
asylum and succour to strangers. There are also houses
of refuge for the poor, called “Misericordias,” at various places,
which are supported by royal gifts, bequests by will, and private
donations.</p>

<p>None but the military can be billeted on private houses; and
even this right is now contested by the camara (municipality) of
Oporto, as contrary to the constitutional charter. Nor are there
any houses of industry for receiving destitute able-bodied, or their
families, except at Lisbon, where I understand there are royal manufactories
in which the poor are employed, as well as at a rope-walk
called the Cordoario. The different religious establishments
are, as I have already observed, in the habit of affording pecuniary
relief, as well as of giving food and medical aid to the destitute of
every description; but the political changes, by suppressing some
and diminishing the resources of all these establishments, must
have greatly reduced this description of charity.</p>

<p>In most towns and large villages there are schools to which the
poor may send their children free of expense; but they receive
neither food nor clothing, and the instruction is extremely limited.
The masters are allowed a small stipend by the Government.</p>

<p>Relatives are forced to aid each other, in the degrees of father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
mother, child, brother and sister, in cases of want: for persons
impotent through age, there are houses of charity, called “Recolhimentos,”
in most cities and considerable towns, where a limited
number of aged or infirm poor of both sexes are lodged, clothed,
and fed. These establishments are supported in part by royal
gifts, and in part by the different municipalities; but no provision
is made for the attendance of the sick poor at their own dwellings,
nor are they in any case boarded with individuals, or billeted on
private houses; but if they have relatives in the degrees above-mentioned,
these are bound to assist them, if able to do so.</p>

<p>There are public hospitals in most cities and towns, where the
sick poor are received and treated gratis. There are also lying-in
hospitals, which receive pregnant women (without inquiring as
to their being married or not) without any charge; but I am not
aware of the existence of any regulation which obliges the medical
officers of these establishments to deliver women at their own
dwellings, although this is frequently done voluntarily.</p>

<h5><i>Children.</i></h5>

<p>A law or decree, issued in 1772, imposes equally on both
parents the duty of maintaining their children, whether legitimate
or illegitimate, where they have the means of doing so; and
the parentage in the latter case, if the father can be ascertained or
is acknowledged. Brothers and sisters are equally bound to assist
each other.</p>

<p>But in cases where the parents either have not the means or
want inclination to support their illegitimate child, a ready resource
is offered by the “Casas dos Expostos” which exist in most
towns. These establishments for foundlings are provided with
rodas, or revolving boxes, into which the infant is placed, and is
received without inquiry. The practice of thus abandoning infants
to be reared by public charity, prevails, I am assured, to a painful
extent in Portugal.</p>

<h5><i>Cripples, Deaf and Dumb, and Blind.</i></h5>

<p>At Lisbon there is, I understand, an establishment for the
reception of the deaf and dumb.</p>

<h5><i>Idiots and Lunatics.</i></h5>

<p>At Lisbon there is an establishment for lunatics, called the
Hospital of St. Joseph, where lunatics and idiots are received and
supported gratuitously, if without means. Better treatment and
greater comforts may be obtained for patients ably to pay for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
same. This institution is partly supported by the Government,
and partly by voluntary contributions, in the same manner as the
misericordias in provincial towns.</p>

<p>It may be observed generally, that in Catholic countries, the
care of administering to the wants, both physical and moral, of the
poor, being left in a great degree to the clergy and religious establishments,
the action of the civil government, as well as of
private benevolence in their favour, is much less visible, and far
more confined than in Protestant states.</p>

<p>Oporto, April 24, 1834.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">The Azores.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<h5><i>Vagrants.</i></h5>

<p>In the Azores mendicity is limited to the aged and infirm poor,
and to the crippled and blind, for whom there is no legal provision;
they are therefore dependent on the charity of the wealthy,
to whom they make a weekly application and receive alms. There
are no houses for their reception, or asylum of any description, but
they obtain a distribution of victuals from the convents, of whatever
surplus food remains after the friars and nuns have dined.</p>

<p>Vagrants are not allowed; such people are liable to be imprisoned,
and on conviction may be shipped off to India, Angola,
&amp;c., or employed on public works, by decrees of the 16th May,
1641, 19th May, 1684, 4th March, 1688, 7th March, 1691, and 4th
November, 1755. Those decrees, though severe, have had a good
effect in exterminating vagrancy in the Azores. No relief is
given to persons seeking work.</p>

<h5><i>Destitute Able-bodied.</i></h5>

<p>There are no laws for granting relief to the poor of any description,
excepting the sick. Able-bodied men in want of work can
always find employment on seeking it.</p>

<p>Public schools for teaching reading and writing are established
in each municipal district, where the children of the poor are
taught gratis. A small tribute on the wine produce of the country
is levied for payment of these schools, called the Literary Subsidy,
and public professors are paid out of it also, who teach Latin,
grammar, rhetoric and philosophy to all who choose to attend.</p>

<p>The laws of Portugal oblige the proprietors of entailed property
to give alimentary allowances to their children and brothers
and sisters, in proportion to their own means and the wants of the
applicants. Children coming into possession of property are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
obliged to assist their parents and brothers, if in necessity. The
poor, however, are left to themselves, and to the stimulus of natural
affection; and cases are very rare in which appeals are made in
vain; but lawsuits are very common to oblige the rich heir of
entailed property to give aliments to a brother or sister, as the
elder brother takes the whole estate, and the younger branches
are entirely dependent on him, if the father has not left money or
unentailed property to distribute amongst his other children.</p>

<h5><i>Sick.</i></h5>

<p>In every municipal district there is a public hospital called the
Misericordia, <i>i.e.</i> house of mercy, for the reception of the sick
poor, supported by endowments of land and bequests of money
from pious people long since deceased, and voluntary contributions
of living persons, where the sick are well treated, and when
cured are sent to their families, and if in great distress a small sum
of money is given to assist them. These hospitals contain generally
from 200 to 300 sick, and are, generally speaking, well
conducted by the governors, stewards, medical attendants, and
nurses. Foreign seamen are also admitted on the respective consuls
paying 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> per diem for diet and attendance.</p>

<p>In cases where the hospitals are full, and cannot accommodate
any more patients, medicines are given to applicants, and surgical
and medical advice gratis from the hospital practitioners.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Children.</span></h5>

<h6><i>Illegitimate.</i></h6>

<p>The mother must support it in case she chooses to suckle the
child herself; if, on the contrary, the sense of shame overcomes
her maternal feelings, and she takes it to the misericordia, where
there is a private place to receive the infant, it is immediately
taken care of, and put out to nurse at the expense of the municipality
until seven years of age, when it is apprenticed (if a male)
to some trade or handicraft, or to a farmer; if a female to
domestic service in some family, where it is fed and clothed
until of an age to earn wages. In nine cases out of ten,
the practice is to take the child to the misericordia, as pregnancy
is more easily concealed here than in other countries, by the peculiar
dress of the common class of women. The municipality are
at the expense of maintenance of the children, and if their funds
are scanty, the State pays the deficiency.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<h6><i>Orphans, Foundlings, and Deserted Children.</i></h6>

<p><i>Orphans.</i>&mdash;Various laws have been promulgated in favour of
orphans, for whom the respective local magistrates were appointed
judges and protectors, which duty now devolves on the justices of
the peace. If any property belongs to them, proper guardians
are appointed to take care of it, and to educate the children; if
none, they are under the municipal protection until of age to be
put to some trade or calling, service, &amp;c., in cases where their relatives
are unable to take charge of them.</p>

<p><i>Foundlings.</i>&mdash;Foundlings are taken charge of and treated as
orphans; there are several funds set apart for their support by
express decrees of former sovereigns of Portugal; they are received
into the misericordias, and supported by the chamber of
municipality.</p>

<p><i>Deserted Children whose Parents are known.</i>&mdash;Deserted
children are also reputed as foundlings or orphans, and have
similar care taken of them by the municipal authorities; the instances
are extremely rare of children being deserted by their parents,
which is justly held in abhorrence by all classes of persons.</p>

<h5><i>Cripples, Deaf and Dumb, Blind, Idiots and Lunatics.</i></h5>

<p>There are no establishments whatsoever of any kind; they live
on the alms bestowed weekly by the benevolent.</p>

<p>In general there prevails much love and affection between parents
and children, and from the children much obedience and
respect towards their parents, to which they are exhorted by the
clergy, who inculcate great subjection to their parents on all
occasions.</p>

<p>The poorest able-bodied labourer abhors begging; his utmost
exertions are therefore employed to support himself and family;
and it is only in cases of sickness, or other corporeal impediment,
that he ever has recourse to alms.</p>

<p>In the Island of St. Mary’s wheat and barley are chiefly cultivated,
but little Indian corn; much waste land is to be seen,
arising from the absence of the great proprietors, who live in St.
Michael’s or at Lisbon.</p>

<p>At Terceira more wheat than Indian corn is to be seen under
cultivation; much land lying waste from the want of capital or
enterprise in the proprietors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>At St. George’s, being a volcanic soil, there are more vineyards
and pasture land than arable.</p>

<p>Gracioza being flat in surface, and having a strong clay soil,
much barley and wheat is grown, but little Indian corn; the poor
subsist chiefly on barley-bread, pulse, &amp;c.; it also produces much
brandy from the low-priced wines.</p>

<p>Pico being very mountainous and volcanic, the whole island is
one continued vineyard; little soil for corn; the inhabitants depend
upon the other islands for the supplies of bread.</p>

<p>Fayal, partly vineyard, the rest corn land and pasture: all the
principal proprietors of Pico living at Fayal, the poor of Pico are
chiefly supplied from thence by their landlords.</p>

<p>Corvo produces grain, &amp;c., for its consumption only.</p>

<p>Flores: some wheat and Indian corn is exported from thence,
also bacon and hams, as large quantities of hogs are bred in that
island.</p>

<p>A great deal of land is still uncultivated throughout the Azores,
so that no able-bodied labourer can want employment, and for two
centuries to come there will be employment for the increasing population.
The temperature of the climate, ranging from 55° to 76°
of Fahrenheit, reducing the physical wants of man as to clothing,
fuel, &amp;c.; and the abundance of vegetables, fruits, &amp;c., renders the
poor man’s lot easier than in colder climates. In the hospitals
there is no limit of rations to the sick patients; they have bread,
meat, poultry, milk, &amp;c., in abundance. The state of criminals in
the prisons is however dreadful; they are not fed by government,
and must die if not succoured by relatives, and the casual supply
of bread sent them from the misericordia in cases of extreme need:
this however is not obligatory on the part of the hospital. Criminals,
after sentence to the galleys, are allowed a loaf of bread per
day, but nothing more.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Canary Islands.</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<h5><i>Mendicity, Vagrants, Destitute Able-bodied, Impotent through
Age.</i></h5>

<p>Mendicity does prevail to a great extent in the Canary Islands.
There is no legal provision whatever for the relief or support of the
poor included in the denominations stated above; casual charity is
the only resource; but as the natives for the most part remain in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the places where they were born, there are very few who have not
some relations and acquaintance, from whom they receive occasional
assistance. From the nature of the climate, the wants of
the poor, when not suffering from sickness, are very limited;
having food sufficient to satisfy their hunger, they are scarcely
affected by the privations so sensibly felt by the poor in northern
climates. “Goffro,” (which is maize, barley or wheat, roasted,
and ground by the hand between two stones,) mixed with water or
milk, potatoes and other vegetables, with sometimes a small piece
of salt fish, constitute the general food of the peasantry throughout
the islands. In the towns the artisans live better, obtaining bread,
potatoes, salt fish, and sometimes butcher’s meat.</p>

<h5><i>Sick.</i></h5>

<p>In Santa Cruz there is one hospital for the poor, but the accommodation
is very limited (24 beds), in no degree proportional
to the wants of the population.</p>

<p>In the town of Laguna is one also, larger than Santa Cruz,
and tolerably maintained.</p>

<p>At Las Palmas, the capital of the island of Canary, is the
largest and best hospital in the islands; near that town also, is the
hospital of St. Lazarus, exclusively for lepers, of which there are
considerable numbers. This hospital is well kept up, and the
building in a good state of repair, with a garden walled round.
The unfortunate inmates are said to be comfortably provided for.</p>

<h5><i>Children, Illegitimate; Orphans, Foundlings, Deserted
Children.</i></h5>

<p>There are no legal regulations as to illegitimate children; their
support therefore falls on the mother. There is a foundling hospital
at Laguna in Teneriffe, and another at Las Palmas in Canary;
in each a turning-box, and a great number of children are
by this means disposed of. In the hospital of Santa Cruz is also
a turning-box; the infants left are understood to be sent to Laguna.
Children placed in the box have usually some mark by
which they may be recognised, and they are given up to parents
when claimed. There is no other provision for children.</p>

<h5><i>Cripples, Deaf, Dumb, and Blind.</i></h5>

<p>Live with their parents or relations, or subsist by casual
charity. No provision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Idiots and Lunatics.</i></h5>

<p>No particular establishment; live with their relations. When
violent, they are placed in the hospitals or gaols.</p>

<p>Almost all the land in the Canary Islands is cultivated by agreement
between the owners of the land and a class of persons called
“medianeros” (middlemen), intelligent husbandmen; the conditions
are simple: that the medianero shall cultivate the land, and
find half the seed, he retaining half the produce; the other half
is delivered to the landlord in kind.</p>

<p>The peasantry are a robust and hardy race, laborious and
frugal. There is a great deal of family affection among them.
Considerable numbers emigrate to the Havannah and Puerto
Rico ostensibly, but it is believed that they are taken to Caraccas
and other American countries, once dependencies of the Spanish
crown.</p>

<h3>GREECE.</h3>

<p>There are two sets of answers from Greece to
the Commissioners’ questions. One a general one,
by the Secretary of State for the Interior, the other
from Patras, by Mr. Crowe, His Majesty’s Consul.
It will be seen from the following extracts from the
Government report, (pp. 665, 666, 667,) that there
are scarcely any charitable institutions.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<h4><i>Vagrants.</i></h4>

<p>Before the Revolution, two classes of vagrants existed in
Greece; of these, one class consisted of those individuals who,
having no property of their own, and being averse to labour, lived
by robbery; the other class consisted of those persons who were
indeed destitute, but refusing to labour, did not at the same time
resort to robbery: the latter existed by the charity of their relations,
and of other benevolent individuals, the former were constantly
pursued by the Turkish police.</p>

<p>In two provinces only of the new Greek State, viz. Thravari in
Acarnania, and Cloutzinas of Kalavryta, does systematic beggary
exist; in these places, many persons mutilated their new-born
children for the express purpose of exciting the compassion of the
public; but neither before the Revolution, during the Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
nor even now, is there any public establishment for the relief of
either of the above two classes of vagrants; and notwithstanding
that during the Revolution the number of these vagrants increased
it is now certain that their numbers have sensibly diminished
and it is to be hoped that as soon as the municipalities are regularly
established, all these individuals will be obliged to labour for
their subsistence.</p>

<p>There exists no public institution or decree organizing the
relief to be granted to the poor in Greece; neither did anything
of the kind exist before the Revolution, although the country was
formed into municipalities. It was feared that the Ottoman authorities
would appropriate to themselves any resources which
might be set apart for the poor. Charitable subscriptions were
therefore the only means by which the poor, sick, &amp;c. obtained
relief.</p>

<h4><i>Impotent through Age, and Sick.</i></h4>

<p>No regulations ever existed on these heads. The aged who
were destitute received, and still receive, assistance from the charitably
disposed, and from the monasteries; but this assistance is
voluntary, not obligatory.</p>

<p>With regard to hospitals, there are only two, one at Nauplia
and one at Syra; the first is at present given up to the military
service, and the second, belonging to the municipality of Syra, is
maintained by a small duty levied on merchandize; the one at
Nauplia was formerly supported in the same manner.</p>

<h4><i>Children.</i></h4>

<p>The support of bastards falls upon their fathers. With regard
to foundlings, who are generally left clandestinely at the church
doors, the local authorities take charge of them, and intrust them
to nurses, whose expenses are defrayed by the government;
benevolent individuals likewise frequently take charge of them,
and bring them up at their own expense. The number of foundlings
supported by the government barely exceeds forty throughout
the whole State, by which it appears that depravity of morals
in Greece is not great.</p>

<p>For the support of destitute orphans, an establishment (the
Orphanotropheion) exists at Ægina, where many are brought up
at the expense of the government, and are taught to read and
write, and various trades. However, the nearest relations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
orphans generally consider it to be a religious duty to take care
of them; so that, in consequence of this praiseworthy feeling,
they are seldom left entirely destitute, unless they have no relations,
or unless the latter have no means of assistance at their
disposal. Moreover, there are numerous benevolent persons who
are in the habit of taking orphans into their houses, and bringing
them up at their own expense.</p>

<p>Labour hitherto has not much increased in Greece; the labourers
are industrious, frugal, and attached to their relations.</p>

<p>I may add, that in consequence of the vast extent of land in
Greece in comparison with the number of its inhabitants, the
latter apply themselves mostly to agriculture and the care of
flocks, by which means they procure ample means of subsistence;
and the few manufactures which exist in Greece being all made
by hand, sufficient employment is to be procured by every individual.
These are the reasons why the number of the poor is so
limited, notwithstanding that late events were so much opposed
to the progress of arts and industry.</p>

</div>

<hr />

<h3>EUROPEAN TURKEY.</h3>

<p>The only remaining portion of Europe which has
furnished answers to the Commissioners’ questions
is European Turkey; with respect to which it may
be enough to say, that the only charitable institutions
mentioned in the return are religious establishments
and khans, in which vagrants are allowed
to remain a few days, and receive food; and schools
attached to the mosques, in which children of every
description receive gratuitous instruction in reading
and writing.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<h2>ABSENCE OF SURPLUS POPULATION.</h2>

<div class="sidenote">General
absence, in
the countries
not
subject to
compulsory
relief, of a
surplus
population.</div>

<p>One of the most striking circumstances connected
with the countries which we have last considered is
the accuracy with which the population seems to be
regulated with reference to the demand for labour.
In the ill-administered parts of England there is in
general no approach to any such regulation. That
sort of population which, from our familiarity with
it, has acquired the technical name of a surplus
population, not only continues stagnant in places
where its services are no longer required, but often
springs up and increases without any increase of
the means of profitable employment. The parochial
returns, forming part B. of this Appendix, are
full of complaints of a want of labourers in one
parish, and of an over-supply in another; without
any tendency of the redundancy to supply the deficiency.
In time, of course, the deficient parish is
filled up by natural increase; but in the mean time
the population of the redundant parish does not
seem to diminish. In general, indeed, it goes on
increasing with unchecked rapidity, until, in the
worst administered portions of the kingdom, a state
of things has arisen, of which the cure is so difficult,
that nothing but the certainty of absolute and
almost immediate ruin from its increase, or even
from its continuance, would have induced the proprietors
to encounter the dangers of the remedy.
Nothing like this, indeed, exists in any of the
countries affording compulsory relief, except Berne,
which have given us returns. But they provide
against its occurrence, as we have already observed,
by subjecting the labouring classes, indeed all classes
except the opulent, to strict regulation and control,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
by restraining their marriages, forcing them to take
service, and prohibiting their change of abode unless
they have the consent of the commune in which they
wish to settle. By a vigilant exertion of these
means, the population of the north of Europe and
Germany seems in general to be proportioned to
the means of employment and subsistence; but in
the countries which have not adopted the compulsory
system the same results are produced without
interference or restriction. Complaints are often
made in the different returns of the idleness, the
drunkenness, and the improvidence of the labouring
classes, but never of their disproportionate number.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Condition of the labouring classes.</h2>

<p>Another and a very interesting portion of the
information which the intelligence and industry of
His Majesty’s foreign Ministers and Consuls have
enabled us to submit to the public, consists of the
answers to the questions respecting labourers. In
order to facilitate a comparison between the state of
the English and foreign populations, the questions
proposed were in general the same as had been
already answered in England, either by the population
returns, or by the returns to the questions
circulated in England by the Poor Law Commissioners.</p>

<p>The following questions, being 1, 3, 7, and 8,
correspond to the English questions 8, 10, 13, and
14, of the rural queries:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. (8 of English questions.) What is the general
amount of the wages of an able-bodied male
labourer, by the day, the week, the month, or the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
year, with and without provisions, in summer and
in winter?</p>

<p>3. (10 of English questions.) What in the whole
might an average labourer, obtaining an average
amount of employment, both in day-work and in
piece-work, expect to earn in a year, including
harvest work, and the whole of all his advantages
and means of living?</p>

<p>7. (13 of English questions.) What in the whole
might a labourer’s wife and four children, aged 14,
11, 8, and 5 years respectively, (the eldest a boy),
expect to earn in a year, obtaining, as in the former
case, an average amount of employment?</p>

<p>8. (14 of English questions.) Could such a
family subsist on the aggregate earnings of the
father, mother, and children; and if so, on what
food?</p>

<p>The following is a digest of the answers from all
the agricultural parishes in England which have
given returns to the corresponding questions circulated
by the Poor Law Commissioners:&mdash;</p>

<h3>Agricultural wages in England.</h3>

<p>Q. 8. Weekly wages, with or without beer or
cider, in summer and winter?</p>

<p>254 parishes give an average in summer, with
beer or cider, of per week, 10<i>s.</i> 4¾<i>d.</i></p>

<p>522 parishes give an average in summer, without
beer or cider, of per week, 10<i>s.</i> 5½<i>d.</i></p>

<p>200 parishes give an average in winter, with beer
or cider, of per week, 9<i>s.</i> 2¼<i>d.</i></p>

<p>544 parishes give an average in winter, without
beer or cider, of per week, 9<i>s.</i> 11¾<i>d.</i></p>

<p>Q. 10. What in the whole might an average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
labourer, obtaining an average amount of employment,
both in day-work and piece-work, expect to
earn in the year, including harvest work, and the
value of all his other advantages and means of
living, except parish relief?</p>

<p>Q. 13. What in the whole might a labourer’s
wife and four children, aged 14, 11, 8, and 5 years
respectively, (the eldest a boy,) expect to earn in
the year, obtaining, as in the former case, an average
amount of employment?</p>

<h2>Wages and subsistence of foreign labourers.</h2>

<p>We now add a digest of the foreign answers to
the corresponding questions, and also to Question 6:
“What can women and children under 16, earn
per week in summer, in winter, and in harvest,
and how employed?” a question as to which the
English answers do not admit of tabular statement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>We have arranged the answers under seven
heads: 1. Wages of artisans; 2. of agricultural
labourers; 3. of labourers whom the author of the
return appears not to have included in either of the
other two classes; 4. of women; 5. of children;
6. of the labourer’s wife and four children; and
7. the food on which the supposed family could
subsist, on their average annual earnings and means
of living.</p>

    <p>Hence will be seen that the master of such a family must earn
    daily, during the whole year, nearly 2<i>r.d.</i> banco, and
    consequently no masons, carpenters, smiths, &amp;c. can be included in
    this class. If the husband, wife, or children are sick for any

<h2>Comparison between the state of the English and Foreign Labouring
Classes.</h2>

<p>On comparing these statements respecting the
wages, subsistence, and mortality of those portions
of Continental Europe which have furnished returns
with the corresponding statements respecting England,
it will be found, that on every point England
stands in the most favourable, or nearly the most
favourable, position. With respect to money wages,
the superiority of the English agricultural labourer
is very marked. It may be fairly said that his wages
are nearly double the average of agricultural wages
in the Continent. And as fuel is generally cheaper
in England than in the Continent, and clothing is
universally so, his relative advantage with respect
to those important objects of consumption is still
greater.</p>

<p>On the other hand, as food is dearer in England
than in any other part of Europe, the English
labourer, especially if he have a large family, necessarily
loses on this part of his expenditure a part
of the benefit of his higher wages, and, if the
relative dearness of food were very great, might
lose the whole. On comparing, however, the answers
to the 14th English and 8th Foreign question,
it appears probable, that even in this respect
the English family has an advantage, though of
course less than in any other. Of the 687 English
parishes which have given an answer, from which
the diet of the family can be inferred, 491, or about
five-sevenths, state, that it could obtain meat; and
of the 196 which give answers implying that it
could not get meat, 43 are comprised in Essex and
Sussex, two of the most pauperised districts in the
kingdom. But in the foreign answers, meat is the
exception instead of the rule. In the north of
Europe the usual food seems to be potatoes and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
oatmeal, or rye bread, accompanied frequently by
fish, but only occasionally by meat.</p>

<p>In Germany and Holland the principal food appears
to be rye bread, vegetables, the produce of
the dairy, and meat once or twice a week.</p>

<p>In Belgium, potatoes, rye bread, milk, butter and
cheese, and occasionally pork.</p>

<p>The French returns almost exclude fresh meat,
and indicate a small proportion of salted meat.
Thus we are told, that in Havre they live on bread
and vegetables; never animal food, or very rarely.
In Brittany, on buck wheat, barley bread, potatoes,
cabbages, and about 6 lbs. of pork weekly. In the
Gironde, on rye bread, soup made of millet, Indian
corn, now and then some salt provision, and vegetables,
rarely if ever butcher’s meat. In the Basses
Pyrenées, on vegetable soups, potatoes, salt fish,
pork and bacon, seldom or ever butcher’s meat. In
the Bouches du Rhone, on vegetables, bread, and
farinaceous substances made into soup, and bouillie
about once a week. Their food in Piedmont is said
to be the simplest and coarsest; no meat, and twice
as much maize flour as wheat flour. In Portugal,
salt fish, vegetable soup, with oil or lard, and maize
bread.</p>

<p>Further evidence as to the relative state of the
bulk of the population of England is afforded by
the ratio of its mortality.</p>

<p>The only countries in which the mortality appears
to be so small as in England, are, Norway,
in which it is ¹⁄₅₄, and the Basses Pyrenées, in which
it is ¹⁄₅₆<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>. In all the other countries which have
given returns it exceeds the English proportion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
sometimes by doubling it, and in the majority of
instances by more than one fourth.</p>

<p>A portion of our apparent superiority arises from
the rapidity with which our population is increasing;
but though the proportion of our births exceeds
the average proportion of Europe, the difference
as to births is small when compared with the
difference as to deaths, and in a great part of the
north of Europe and Germany the proportion of
births is greater than our own, and therefore the
longevity of the population still more inferior to
that of England than it appears to be.</p>

  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
